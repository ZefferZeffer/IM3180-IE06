lm17jkl,commentonpost,Smelly_Jockrash,"This is such a dumb and moronic post lol... Someone's NAME is quite literally a NOUN. Sure, his kids name is fucking weird as fuck and I have no idea how to even start to pronounce it but, it's still a noun. It is his name, what he is called and what he goes by. 

Elon is weird af, quirky as hell and, I genuinely believe he is on the ""spectrum"" but he's also insanely smart, and smarter, richer and more successful than anyone here will ever be. I personally think he's kinda funny because he just doesn't gaf at all but, he's a weird ass dude for sure lol. 

And for those who didn't know, he was a hardcore democrat up until semi-recently - as in within the last 3-4 years -  so to call him a republican is fair game now but, historically speaking he's always been a democrat. He converted and switched sides and went full force republican the last few years. 

Whatever tf he named his kid, while insanely weird and stupid, it's also not a pronoun. It's a literal noun. We all know exactly what kind of pronouns he is referring to, and this hxlden twitter/X user is a fucking idiot who has clearly never taken a basic English class. She didn't ""get him good"" at all because, if she has then she'd know the difference between a noun and a pronoun. 

For those who are illiterate though...

NOUN...
