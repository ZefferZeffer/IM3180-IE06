They deliberately left that shit out of the gameplay trailer and swapped her for the game because they knew.

From what I've been told this is more common with females due to the fact they tend to have a rounder facial structure. I can't play LA Noire pretty much at all for that reason and in games like Horizon Forbidden West the characters can be really hit or miss for me but it seems to be more common with female models.

Watch the full thing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI)

She's talking at GDC to other game developers about representation and diversity in games or avoiding accidental racism. That specific segment talks about how these developers can try and raise awareness in their respective companies about these topics. Like ""do not wait until the end to ask your consultants"" (which is valid, because the earlier an issue is caught, the easier it is fixed). Or to talk to higher ups to stress the importance of these topics. And if they don't listen, connect with the marketing people to ""terrify them"" of potential negative repercussions in case they fuck up the narrative and end up being called racist (for example). Stressing the point that there is value in doing research or bringing in outside voices to get a second opinion.

And you might or might not agree with her points there, which is fine, but at no point in the video is she calling for slander or extortion. Not even indirectly. Also keep in mind, that she is talking to an audience that is already interested in this topic, so it's not like she is trying to ""convert"" anyone to her political beliefs.",1,deleted,1dfpot5

l8ssu8a,l8qlzpf,arparso,,"And when has this actually happened? Because I genuinely have never seen that particular story before. Not even the tweet that OP posted references Sweet Baby Inc in particular (nor does it provide proof or details about what happened).

Suicide Squad used the services of Sweet Baby Inc and got lots of mediocre and bad reviews. God of War Ragnar√∂k and Alan Wake II were critically acclaimed and loved by players alike - they, too, hired writing assistance from Sweet Baby Inc. Tons of other game devs didn't hire them and still got a lot of love from critics and gamers alike.

l8uytmu,l8u9dce,arparso,,"I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing anymore, maybe I'm misunderstanding!?

The original accusation I was commenting on was regarding the company Sweet Baby Inc., a video game consultation firm specializing in writing and narrative development with a focus on representation and diversity. The comment was accusing them of extortion: ""If you refuse their service, they'll slander you""

I have yet to see any evidence that this actually ever happened.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance has nothing to do with that. Sweet Baby Inc. didn't even exist yet when that game released. And despite KC:D having to deal with some controversy about its historical accuracy (or lack thereof) and some comments of its maker, I'm not aware of any organized boycotts or slanderous reviews massively critizing the game for that. Instead, the game was very successful and at least the PC version garnered mostly favourable reviews. Most criticism was aimed at the many bugs and that the pseudo-realistic gameplay was not for everyone and could get dull and boring for some players. Which are fair points, IMO.

Accusations of sexism and vulgar humor against the Wukong developer also exist (and there is actual proof of the comments made by one of it's co-founders or the vulgar recruitment ads). These particular issues were brought up by Chinese gamers themselves, with no affiliation to Sweet Baby Inc. or any other ""woke"" western entity trying to push some agenda of political correctness. And yes, there are western articles about this, but they are merely reporting about that controversy that started in China before.

So, returning to my original point: I still fail to see any evidence that Sweet Baby Inc. is running around and extorting innocent game devs to hire them and pay enormous fees. And threaten to slander and ruin them otherwise. To me it looks like they are just a popular target for anti-woke gamers to blame for the game industry going ""woke"" or for ""ruining"" games - just because some people don't agree with their politics.

The fact that IGN, Kotaku etc. keeps doing exactly that to the companies that don't employ these fucking idiots for their games doesn't mean that SBI is making them do it but since they all circlejerk eachother on twitter constantly it's clear that they are working as a team in this regard.

The IGN articles about the ""sexism"" is literally just badly translated chinese that they then made into ""sexist"" statements...

I'm sure gaming companies hire SBI and the like to make their games worse for no reason. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that their games will be lambasted on IGN and by other ""gaming journalists"" if they don't appease them.

I see a very slippery path where the valid criticism of these entities turns in to outright bigotry towards the groups that these companies are trying to ""represent"". I've already seen it. This extremely valid pushback against these companies is often mistaken by actual bigots as a call or a signal that it's ok to be a bigot or a racist now and that gives everyone in the anti DEI movement a bad name. Then these companies use that pushback and the emboldened bigots as evidence for the necessity of their existence. We are not trying to normalise bigotry, we are simply trying to push back against the enforcement of arbitrary corporate diversity charts and that's a distinction that needs to be made. 

The fact that I feel the need to clarify this shows the damage these companies are doing, not only to the games but inadvertently to the people that are against these companies, and the people that are subject to more bigotry and harassment by emboldened bad actors. Remember who the enemy is, it's not the people they are dishonestly trying to represent, they are merely a scapegoat for a new revenue stream. Hell the enemy isn't even the bigots, they can have their opinion. The enemy is the companies that use forced diversity quotas that are dishonest, corrosive, unrealistic and insidious to make money and leech off the industry.

You're the one making a lot of assumptions about me just because I supplied more context to the game being discussed. Covering up all female characters was just an easy example to point at when it comes to Chinese censorship in games.

Otherwise, you have nothing to stand on.

It's really obvious they can't badmouth Sony‚Äîwe all saw what happened with Helldivers. So it makes sense why he is being roundabout in their article.

Watch the full thing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI)

She's talking at GDC to other game developers about representation and diversity in games or avoiding accidental racism. That specific segment talks about how these developers can try and raise awareness in their respective companies about these topics. Like ""do not wait until the end to ask your consultants"" (which is valid, because the earlier an issue is caught, the easier it is fixed). Or to talk to higher ups to stress the importance of these topics. And if they don't listen, connect with the marketing people to ""terrify them"" of potential negative repercussions in case they fuck up the narrative and end up being called racist (for example). Stressing the point that there is value in doing research or bringing in outside voices to get a second opinion.

And you might or might not agree with her points there, which is fine, but at no point in the video is she calling for slander or extortion. Not even indirectly.

Suicide Squad used the services of Sweet Baby Inc and got lots of mediocre and bad reviews. God of War Ragnar√∂k and Alan Wake II were critically acclaimed and loved by players alike - they, too, hired writing assistance from Sweet Baby Inc. Tons of other game devs didn't hire them and still got a lot of love from critics and gamers alike.

l8uytmu,l8u9dce,arparso,,"I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing anymore, maybe I'm misunderstanding!?

The original accusation I was commenting on was regarding the company Sweet Baby Inc., a video game consultation firm specializing in writing and narrative development with a focus on representation and diversity. The comment was accusing them of extortion: ""If you refuse their service, they'll slander you""

I have yet to see any evidence that this actually ever happened.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance has nothing to do with that. Sweet Baby Inc. didn't even exist yet when that game released. And despite KC:D having to deal with some controversy about its historical accuracy (or lack thereof) and some comments of its maker, I'm not aware of any organized boycotts or slanderous reviews massively critizing the game for that. Instead, the game was very successful and at least the PC version garnered mostly favourable reviews. Most criticism was aimed at the many bugs and that the pseudo-realistic gameplay was not for everyone and could get dull and boring for some players. Which are fair points, IMO.

Accusations of sexism and vulgar humor against the Wukong developer also exist (and there is actual proof of the comments made by one of it's co-founders or the vulgar recruitment ads). These particular issues were brought up by Chinese gamers themselves, with no affiliation to Sweet Baby Inc. or any other ""woke"" western entity trying to push some agenda of political correctness. And yes, there are western articles about this, but they are merely reporting about that controversy that started in China before.

So, returning to my original point: I still fail to see any evidence that Sweet Baby Inc. is running around and extorting innocent game devs to hire them and pay enormous fees. And threaten to slander and ruin them otherwise. To me it looks like they are just a popular target for anti-woke gamers to blame for the game industry going ""woke"" or for ""ruining"" games - just because some people don't agree with their politics.

The fact that IGN, Kotaku etc. keeps doing exactly that to the companies that don't employ these fucking idiots for their games doesn't mean that SBI is making them do it but since they all circlejerk eachother on twitter constantly it's clear that they are working as a team in this regard.

Watch the full thing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI)

She's talking at GDC to other game developers about representation and diversity in games or avoiding accidental racism. That specific segment talks about how these developers can try and raise awareness in their respective companies about these topics. Like ""do not wait until the end to ask your consultants"" (which is valid, because the earlier an issue is caught, the easier it is fixed). Or to talk to higher ups to stress the importance of these topics. And if they don't listen, connect with the marketing people to ""terrify them"" of potential negative repercussions in case they fuck up the narrative and end up being called racist (for example). Stressing the point that there is value in doing research or bringing in outside voices to get a second opinion.

And you might or might not agree with her points there, which is fine, but at no point in the video is she calling for slander or extortion. Not even indirectly.

l8uytmu,l8u9dce,arparso,,"I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing anymore, maybe I'm misunderstanding!?

The original accusation I was commenting on was regarding the company Sweet Baby Inc., a video game consultation firm specializing in writing and narrative development with a focus on representation and diversity. The comment was accusing them of extortion: ""If you refuse their service, they'll slander you""

I have yet to see any evidence that this actually ever happened.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance has nothing to do with that. Sweet Baby Inc. didn't even exist yet when that game released. And despite KC:D having to deal with some controversy about its historical accuracy (or lack thereof) and some comments of its maker, I'm not aware of any organized boycotts or slanderous reviews massively critizing the game for that. Instead, the game was very successful and at least the PC version garnered mostly favourable reviews. Most criticism was aimed at the many bugs and that the pseudo-realistic gameplay was not for everyone and could get dull and boring for some players. Which are fair points, IMO.

Accusations of sexism and vulgar humor against the Wukong developer also exist (and there is actual proof of the comments made by one of it's co-founders or the vulgar recruitment ads). These particular issues were brought up by Chinese gamers themselves, with no affiliation to Sweet Baby Inc. or any other ""woke"" western entity trying to push some agenda of political correctness. And yes, there are western articles about this, but they are merely reporting about that controversy that started in China before.

So, returning to my original point: I still fail to see any evidence that Sweet Baby Inc. is running around and extorting innocent game devs to hire them and pay enormous fees. And threaten to slander and ruin them otherwise. To me it looks like they are just a popular target for anti-woke gamers to blame for the game industry going ""woke"" or for ""ruining"" games - just because some people don't agree with their politics.

Watch the full thing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI)

She's talking at GDC to other game developers about representation and diversity in games or avoiding accidental racism. That specific segment talks about how these developers can try and raise awareness in their respective companies about these topics. Like ""do not wait until the end to ask your consultants"" (which is valid, because the earlier an issue is caught, the easier it is fixed). Or to talk to higher ups to stress the importance of these topics. And if they don't listen, connect with the marketing people to ""terrify them"" of potential negative repercussions in case they fuck up the narrative and end up being called racist (for example). Stressing the point that there is value in doing research or bringing in outside voices to get a second opinion.

And you might or might not agree with her points there, which is fine, but at no point in the video is she calling for slander or extortion. Not even indirectly.

The original accusation I was commenting on was regarding the company Sweet Baby Inc., a video game consultation firm specializing in writing and narrative development with a focus on representation and diversity. The comment was accusing them of extortion: ""If you refuse their service, they'll slander you""

I have yet to see any evidence that this actually ever happened.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance has nothing to do with that. Sweet Baby Inc. didn't even exist yet when that game released. And despite KC:D having to deal with some controversy about its historical accuracy (or lack thereof) and some comments of its maker, I'm not aware of any organized boycotts or slanderous reviews massively critizing the game for that. Instead, the game was very successful and at least the PC version garnered mostly favourable reviews. Most criticism was aimed at the many bugs and that the pseudo-realistic gameplay was not for everyone and could get dull and boring for some players. Which are fair points, IMO.

Accusations of sexism and vulgar humor against the Wukong developer also exist (and there is actual proof of the comments made by one of it's co-founders or the vulgar recruitment ads). These particular issues were brought up by Chinese gamers themselves, with no affiliation to Sweet Baby Inc. or any other ""woke"" western entity trying to push some agenda of political correctness. And yes, there are western articles about this, but they are merely reporting about that controversy that started in China before.

So, returning to my original point: I still fail to see any evidence that Sweet Baby Inc. is running around and extorting innocent game devs to hire them and pay enormous fees. And threaten to slander and ruin them otherwise. To me it looks like they are just a popular target for anti-woke gamers to blame for the game industry going ""woke"" or for ""ruining"" games - just because some people don't agree with their politics.

The fact that IGN, Kotaku etc. keeps doing exactly that to the companies that don't employ these fucking idiots for their games doesn't mean that SBI is making them do it but since they all circlejerk eachother on twitter constantly it's clear that they are working as a team in this regard.

It's a fallacy which operates on a two-party split opinion where one party sees it as 'bad' and one party sees it as 'good.' Video games are an easy example that support it since there is rarely ever one unified opinion toward video games. There will always be one side who hates them and one side who loves them.",-2,deleted,1dfpot5

Watch the full thing: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfMsxjWgUbI)

She's talking at GDC to other game developers about representation and diversity in games or avoiding accidental racism. That specific segment talks about how these developers can try and raise awareness in their respective companies about these topics. Like ""do not wait until the end to ask your consultants"" (which is valid, because the earlier an issue is caught, the easier it is fixed). Or to talk to higher ups to stress the importance of these topics. And if they don't listen, connect with the marketing people to ""terrify them"" of potential negative repercussions in case they fuck up the narrative and end up being called racist (for example). Stressing the point that there is value in doing research or bringing in outside voices to get a second opinion.

And you might or might not agree with her points there, which is fine, but at no point in the video is she calling for slander or extortion. Not even indirectly. Also keep in mind, that she is talking to an audience that is already interested in this topic, so it's not like she is trying to ""convert"" anyone to her political beliefs.",1,deleted,1dfpot5

Suicide Squad used the services of Sweet Baby Inc and got lots of mediocre and bad reviews. God of War Ragnar√∂k and Alan Wake II were critically acclaimed and loved by players alike - they, too, hired writing assistance from Sweet Baby Inc. Tons of other game devs didn't hire them and still got a lot of love from critics and gamers alike.

l8uytmu,l8u9dce,arparso,,"I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing anymore, maybe I'm misunderstanding!?

The original accusation I was commenting on was regarding the company Sweet Baby Inc., a video game consultation firm specializing in writing and narrative development with a focus on representation and diversity. The comment was accusing them of extortion: ""If you refuse their service, they'll slander you""

I have yet to see any evidence that this actually ever happened.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance has nothing to do with that. Sweet Baby Inc. didn't even exist yet when that game released. And despite KC:D having to deal with some controversy about its historical accuracy (or lack thereof) and some comments of its maker, I'm not aware of any organized boycotts or slanderous reviews massively critizing the game for that. Instead, the game was very successful and at least the PC version garnered mostly favourable reviews. Most criticism was aimed at the many bugs and that the pseudo-realistic gameplay was not for everyone and could get dull and boring for some players. Which are fair points, IMO.

Accusations of sexism and vulgar humor against the Wukong developer also exist (and there is actual proof of the comments made by one of it's co-founders or the vulgar recruitment ads). These particular issues were brought up by Chinese gamers themselves, with no affiliation to Sweet Baby Inc. or any other ""woke"" western entity trying to push some agenda of political correctness. And yes, there are western articles about this, but they are merely reporting about that controversy that started in China before.

So, returning to my original point: I still fail to see any evidence that Sweet Baby Inc. is running around and extorting innocent game devs to hire them and pay enormous fees. And threaten to slander and ruin them otherwise. To me it looks like they are just a popular target for anti-woke gamers to blame for the game industry going ""woke"" or for ""ruining"" games - just because some people don't agree with their politics.

Someone saying ""Go have a coffee with your marketing team and just terrify them with the possibility of what's gonna happen if they don't give you what you want"" is literally extortion. This is exactly how the mafia gets protection money.

The fact that IGN, Kotaku etc. keeps doing exactly that to the companies that don't employ these fucking idiots for their games doesn't mean that SBI is making them do it but since they all circlejerk eachother on twitter constantly it's clear that they are working as a team in this regard.

The IGN articles about the ""sexism"" is literally just badly translated chinese that they then made into ""sexist"" statements...

I'm sure gaming companies hire SBI and the like to make their games worse for no reason. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that their games will be lambasted on IGN and by other ""gaming journalists"" if they don't appease them.

l8uytmu,l8u9dce,arparso,,"I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing anymore, maybe I'm misunderstanding!?

The original accusation I was commenting on was regarding the company Sweet Baby Inc., a video game consultation firm specializing in writing and narrative development with a focus on representation and diversity. The comment was accusing them of extortion: ""If you refuse their service, they'll slander you""

I have yet to see any evidence that this actually ever happened.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance has nothing to do with that. Sweet Baby Inc. didn't even exist yet when that game released. And despite KC:D having to deal with some controversy about its historical accuracy (or lack thereof) and some comments of its maker, I'm not aware of any organized boycotts or slanderous reviews massively critizing the game for that. Instead, the game was very successful and at least the PC version garnered mostly favourable reviews. Most criticism was aimed at the many bugs and that the pseudo-realistic gameplay was not for everyone and could get dull and boring for some players. Which are fair points, IMO.

Accusations of sexism and vulgar humor against the Wukong developer also exist (and there is actual proof of the comments made by one of it's co-founders or the vulgar recruitment ads). These particular issues were brought up by Chinese gamers themselves, with no affiliation to Sweet Baby Inc. or any other ""woke"" western entity trying to push some agenda of political correctness. And yes, there are western articles about this, but they are merely reporting about that controversy that started in China before.

So, returning to my original point: I still fail to see any evidence that Sweet Baby Inc. is running around and extorting innocent game devs to hire them and pay enormous fees. And threaten to slander and ruin them otherwise. To me it looks like they are just a popular target for anti-woke gamers to blame for the game industry going ""woke"" or for ""ruining"" games - just because some people don't agree with their politics.

l8uytmu,l8u9dce,arparso,,"I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing anymore, maybe I'm misunderstanding!?

The original accusation I was commenting on was regarding the company Sweet Baby Inc., a video game consultation firm specializing in writing and narrative development with a focus on representation and diversity. The comment was accusing them of extortion: ""If you refuse their service, they'll slander you""

I have yet to see any evidence that this actually ever happened.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance has nothing to do with that. Sweet Baby Inc. didn't even exist yet when that game released. And despite KC:D having to deal with some controversy about its historical accuracy (or lack thereof) and some comments of its maker, I'm not aware of any organized boycotts or slanderous reviews massively critizing the game for that. Instead, the game was very successful and at least the PC version garnered mostly favourable reviews. Most criticism was aimed at the many bugs and that the pseudo-realistic gameplay was not for everyone and could get dull and boring for some players. Which are fair points, IMO.

Accusations of sexism and vulgar humor against the Wukong developer also exist (and there is actual proof of the comments made by one of it's co-founders or the vulgar recruitment ads). These particular issues were brought up by Chinese gamers themselves, with no affiliation to Sweet Baby Inc. or any other ""woke"" western entity trying to push some agenda of political correctness. And yes, there are western articles about this, but they are merely reporting about that controversy that started in China before.

So, returning to my original point: I still fail to see any evidence that Sweet Baby Inc. is running around and extorting innocent game devs to hire them and pay enormous fees. And threaten to slander and ruin them otherwise. To me it looks like they are just a popular target for anti-woke gamers to blame for the game industry going ""woke"" or for ""ruining"" games - just because some people don't agree with their politics.

The fact that IGN, Kotaku etc. keeps doing exactly that to the companies that don't employ these fucking idiots for their games doesn't mean that SBI is making them do it but since they all circlejerk eachother on twitter constantly it's clear that they are working as a team in this regard.

l8uytmu,l8u9dce,arparso,,"I'm not sure we're talking about the same thing anymore, maybe I'm misunderstanding!?

The original accusation I was commenting on was regarding the company Sweet Baby Inc., a video game consultation firm specializing in writing and narrative development with a focus on representation and diversity. The comment was accusing them of extortion: ""If you refuse their service, they'll slander you""

I have yet to see any evidence that this actually ever happened.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance has nothing to do with that. Sweet Baby Inc. didn't even exist yet when that game released. And despite KC:D having to deal with some controversy about its historical accuracy (or lack thereof) and some comments of its maker, I'm not aware of any organized boycotts or slanderous reviews massively critizing the game for that. Instead, the game was very successful and at least the PC version garnered mostly favourable reviews. Most criticism was aimed at the many bugs and that the pseudo-realistic gameplay was not for everyone and could get dull and boring for some players. Which are fair points, IMO.

Accusations of sexism and vulgar humor against the Wukong developer also exist (and there is actual proof of the comments made by one of it's co-founders or the vulgar recruitment ads). These particular issues were brought up by Chinese gamers themselves, with no affiliation to Sweet Baby Inc. or any other ""woke"" western entity trying to push some agenda of political correctness. And yes, there are western articles about this, but they are merely reporting about that controversy that started in China before.

So, returning to my original point: I still fail to see any evidence that Sweet Baby Inc. is running around and extorting innocent game devs to hire them and pay enormous fees. And threaten to slander and ruin them otherwise. To me it looks like they are just a popular target for anti-woke gamers to blame for the game industry going ""woke"" or for ""ruining"" games - just because some people don't agree with their politics.

The fact that IGN, Kotaku etc. keeps doing exactly that to the companies that don't employ these fucking idiots for their games doesn't mean that SBI is making them do it but since they all circlejerk eachother on twitter constantly it's clear that they are working as a team in this regard.

The original accusation I was commenting on was regarding the company Sweet Baby Inc., a video game consultation firm specializing in writing and narrative development with a focus on representation and diversity. The comment was accusing them of extortion: ""If you refuse their service, they'll slander you""

I have yet to see any evidence that this actually ever happened.

Kingdom Come: Deliverance has nothing to do with that. Sweet Baby Inc. didn't even exist yet when that game released. And despite KC:D having to deal with some controversy about its historical accuracy (or lack thereof) and some comments of its maker, I'm not aware of any organized boycotts or slanderous reviews massively critizing the game for that. Instead, the game was very successful and at least the PC version garnered mostly favourable reviews. Most criticism was aimed at the many bugs and that the pseudo-realistic gameplay was not for everyone and could get dull and boring for some players. Which are fair points, IMO.

Accusations of sexism and vulgar humor against the Wukong developer also exist (and there is actual proof of the comments made by one of it's co-founders or the vulgar recruitment ads). These particular issues were brought up by Chinese gamers themselves, with no affiliation to Sweet Baby Inc. or any other ""woke"" western entity trying to push some agenda of political correctness. And yes, there are western articles about this, but they are merely reporting about that controversy that started in China before.

So, returning to my original point: I still fail to see any evidence that Sweet Baby Inc. is running around and extorting innocent game devs to hire them and pay enormous fees. And threaten to slander and ruin them otherwise. To me it looks like they are just a popular target for anti-woke gamers to blame for the game industry going ""woke"" or for ""ruining"" games - just because some people don't agree with their politics.

Patching it back in is not admitting to censorship and only a knob would think that. They just expect whiny crybabies to get triggered over normal design changes to outfits.
