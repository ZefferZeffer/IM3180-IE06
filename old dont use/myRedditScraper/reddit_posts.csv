,NoStupidQuestions,"Hey all,

This is more of an etiquette question, and since I’ve tried googling it but to no avail I thought I’d come here. 

I have two people who I am friends with on Facebook who have shared their struggle with infertility on their pages openly. Then almost two years ago, they adopted a black baby girl. 

I don’t particularly notice anything out of the ordinary other than spam of their baby and how happy they are as a family, etc. but now that the kid is maybe a toddler and her hair is getting longer…yikes. It’s very clear they don’t know how to care for black hair or haven’t learned any low maintenance black hairstyles, and that poor kids photos are just matted bun after matter bun. 

I am not close to these parents in any way, we only became fb friends about a decade ago when we had one event we both participated in, and so I know that any direct conversation about this might come off as judgy and rude. I just want them to have knowledge of how to care for black hair and their kiddo to not have ungodly childhood photos to look back on. 

I also know that the area they live is not a place where a lot of black people live, and no black beauty or barbershops exist where they can get firsthand experience. I just genuinely want to help, but I also don’t want to come off as “that person”.

I have thought about maybe posting black hair day videos with the tag “this is so important!” But that might sound like it’s coming out of left field and there’s no guarantee that they will see it. 

Is there any nice way to do this? Or should I just “stay in my lane”?

,NoStupidQuestions,"My partner (m35) and I (f35) have a 10 month old and a dog. We’ve bought a house with help from my parents and they think because they helped they deserve a room in our home (which we thought would be okay) but we’ve discovered that its not working. 

My mother is an alcoholic and my father is an enabler/pushover and we’d like to be a family but they are making it hard. 

My mother is always commenting on our parenting style and the food we give our child. It’s becoming very frustrating and hard to hold my tongue when she starts (please keep in mind there is sooooo much more to this but its far too much to type on mobile)


How do we let them know it’s not working without my mother being “the victim” and her using the “we helped you get this house, we can stay/do whatever we want” card? 

Edit:
To answer some questions:

My partner and I have our names on the mortgage, we pay rates, water and electricity, they put money towards it.

We’ve bought a house with help from my parents and they think because they helped they deserve a room in our home (which we thought would be okay) but we’ve discovered that its not working. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother is an alcoholic and my father is an enabler/pushover and we’d like to be a family but they are making it hard. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My mother is always commenting on our parenting style and the food we give our child. It’s becoming very frustrating and hard to hold my tongue when she starts (please keep in mind there is sooooo much more to this but its far too much to type on mobile)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How do we let them know it’s not working without my mother being “the victim” and her using the “we helped you get this house, we can stay/do whatever we want” card? &lt;/p&gt;

,NoStupidQuestions,"*From what I have gathered, American dating culture goes as such:* Initially you date multiple people at once so you don't get too attached and are able to keep your options open. Eventually one person will naturally end up being the person you get close to. Then after a few more weeks you have the conversation about exclusivity. But even if you're dating exclusively, you still might not consider each other boyfriend/girlfriend. And so there is another conversation to be had, officially confirming the relationship somewhere further down the road.

*In my region of the EU the dating culture is very different to the US:* We don't really date multiple people at once. Especially once you've had sex, you are pretty much exclusive with that person regardless of how early you had sex. There is generally no need to have conversations about 'what are we', exclusivity, and whether to call each other BF/GF. It is an unspoken thing that when you're romantically involved with someone in any capacity and you like them and you think there's potential, then that person is your BF/GF and you are exclusive with them.

So I have always read these types of US dating experiences online and was wondering whether this is actually how most dating works in America? I find it interesting because it's so different to most other regions in the world, it would seem. (*Or are there places other than the US which date in this US style?)*

AND THE PINEAL GLAND?
I SPY WITH MY LITTLE EYE and THE PINEAL GLAND.

INTRODUCTION

Have you ever played the classic game ""I Spy with My Little Eye""? It’s a beloved childhood pastime that’s simple yet engaging. But what if there’s more to this familiar phrase than just a fun guessing game? Recently, I had an intriguing thought: could the phrase ""my little eye"" be hinting at something deeper, like the pineal gland?

CHILDHOOD GAME

In ""I Spy with My Little Eye,"" a player chooses an object and gives a clue based on a feature like color or shape. The others then guess what the object is. It’s straightforward and enjoyable, but what if this seemingly innocent game holds a deeper, symbolic meaning?

THE SINGULAR EYE.

The phrase “my little eye” uses the singular form, which got me thinking about the concept of the “third eye.” In various spiritual traditions, the pineal gland is referred to as the “third eye,” representing a higher level of perception beyond physical sight. It’s associated with intuition, insight, and inner vision.

A SYMBOLIC INTERPRETATION

Could “I Spy with My Little Eye” be more than just a game? Perhaps it’s a playful nod to the idea of seeing with our inner eye, or our pineal gland. While the game is about finding objects in plain sight, the singular “eye” might suggest a deeper form of observation—a kind of spiritual or intuitive seeing. This perspective invites us to consider how we interpret everyday language and symbols.

EXPLORING DEEPER MEANINGS

It’s fascinating to think about how common phrases might connect with concepts like the pineal gland. This idea encourages us to look beyond the surface and explore the potential deeper meanings in language and symbols. It’s a reminder that even simple things can have layers of meaning waiting to be discovered.

CONCLUSION

So, the next time you play ""I Spy with My Little Eye,"" consider the possibility that it’s more than just a game. Could it be a playful metaphor for seeing with our inner eye, our pineal gland? It’s a thought-provoking way to look at something familiar and discover new layers of meaning. What do you think about this connection?

&lt;p&gt;If it helps I am recently married Indian male and a 10 year old Corporate professional. I play a lot of badminton and sometimes swimming. Big fan of talk shows, interviews. I love people and a big extrovert. I can literally talk to stranger every day or every hour. I never had too much time for creative and sports hobby until like two years. Was a topper kid all school life and hard working professional later half. Not sure I should be proud of that or not :P&lt;/p&gt;

We are 2 years and 6 months dating and my parents especially my mom is very religious or devoted to Roman Catholic that everyday she is very active there and sometimes she’s not in the house. I cook for my siblings because she got no time for that. My dad works morning until night. 

Me and my partner are really in a serious relationship. We have a start-up business and also my partner has a work. I also help/work with our business. Then suddenly i felt really tired and fatigue , at first i thought it was my pcos but when we checked it to the doctor im already pregnant. We were in shock but really happy about it! 

Im slight worried because i know im really dead when i tell my parents. Long story short, we told them and they were not very happy since we are still not married yet. My mom keeps on repeating that we are sinners, the child is a sin,or  having a baby is a sin. 

It hurt me a lot, that my mother says bad things or curse’s us a lot. Unlike my dad, he was disappointed but understanding at the end. I think the reason why my mom is like that because she’s embarrassed of me. She’s a people pleaser especially to her church friends. 

Financially, we are not that bad. We can afford and we can manage it on out own without our parents money. Its just it hurts a lot and stresses me a lot having a mother like her and in this situation. She keeps messaging me gospels and other religious talks. I get that pre marital sex is a sin. I just want a supportive mother and advice us how to cope this situation.

So I’m a gym rat (or used to be)

I tested it in my free time and couldn’t reproduce the results but there’s definitely been a problem with some tape that is being used by someone

When we start talking I told my intentions and that I don’t casual sex/oral and that I would need to be in a relationship first. 

He kept manipulating me by saying I was young and didn’t understand life yet and that having casual sex is just life. Then ended up saing me when I said no to doing anything with him when we met up. 

I’m wondering why he doesn’t date women maybe his own age now since he was calling me young. I don’t know if I should ask myself that since that isn’t a big age gap. The things he was saying though are kinda like wtf but maybe I was just manipulated a ton and started to somehow believe a little part of it.

,NoStupidQuestions,"A friend of mine got some pretty major surgery, and her doctor wanted her to stay close to his office and the hospital he works at in case of emergencies. So she's got this airbnb and people coming to look after her - now it's my turn for a few days.

All is fine until tonight, when I hear conversations start up around 2 in the damn morning. I try to ignore it until 4, when they start playing music. I go over and knock twice, ring their smart doorbell (whatever it's called) once, and they take eons to come to the door. I actually heard them shut off the music and start debating what to do, like someone thought if they shut up that I'd just go away. I say that I can hear them, and a couple minutes of waiting later, some young woman does come to the door.

The summary of our conversation is this (I'm too tired for a play by play):
- I prefer no music and keeping our voices low, I have work in the morning (I work remote, but I didnt think that mattered)
- She's been here for five years, knows the property manager, airbnbs aren't usually ok here(?), but I ""seem nice"" and she'll try

10 minutes later, more music.

It sounded like she was threatening me with the property manager thing. I'm debating if I should keep fighting, I'm only here for a few days and I don't know of the drama is worth it.

So she&amp;#39;s got this airbnb and people coming to look after her - now it&amp;#39;s my turn for a few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All is fine until tonight, when I hear conversations start up around 2 in the damn morning. I try to ignore it until 4, when they start playing music. I go over and knock twice, ring their smart doorbell (whatever it&amp;#39;s called) once, and they take eons to come to the door. I actually heard them shut off the music and start debating what to do, like someone thought if they shut up that I&amp;#39;d just go away. I say that I can hear them, and a couple minutes of waiting later, some young woman does come to the door.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The summary of our conversation is this (I&amp;#39;m too tired for a play by play):
- I prefer no music and keeping our voices low, I have work in the morning (I work remote, but I didnt think that mattered)
- She&amp;#39;s been here for five years, knows the property manager, airbnbs aren&amp;#39;t usually ok here(?), but I &amp;quot;seem nice&amp;quot; and she&amp;#39;ll try&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;10 minutes later, more music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It sounded like she was threatening me with the property manager thing. I&amp;#39;m debating if I should keep fighting, I&amp;#39;m only here for a few days and I don&amp;#39;t know of the drama is worth it. &lt;/p&gt;

,NoStupidQuestions,"I was asked to be a bridesmaid for my future SIL and I'm a little intimidated. I'm not familiar with weddings in general, so I'm pretty clueless. I have a lot of questions:

Should I wear jewelry? Or just stick to the dress I was told to order and keep it simple?

Do I do a full face of makeup? Like with false lashes and all? If so, I need tips on where to buy those and how to glue them on. I'm looking up tutorials for makeup because I'm not great at that either but it's overwhelming. I'm not sure what would be too much, I always think I look ridiculous with a lot of makeup on so I feel like my judgement is too subjective.

Do I need more than one pair of shoes? I'm guessing we'll be wearing high heels but I can't walk much in those. If i get another pair of shoes for after the ceremony, should they also have heels but maybe shorter? Are flats a no-go?

Do I have to change my dress after the ceremony? If so, should my other dress look like my bridesmaid dress but less flashy? Or can it be a different looking dress? I know the bride usually switches to another, more comfortable version of her wedding dress so I'm wondering if the same goes for bridesmaids.

Do bridesmaids also have to buy a wedding gift? I honestly wasn't expecting this whole thing to be so expensive already, with the bachelorette party alone costing me almost $200. And my dress had to be altered so that was another 250$ total. And I still haven't bought shoes. Since I'm nowhere near financially stable, I'm wondering how much should a wedding gift cost so I can try and budget for that without going broke...

Is there anything else I should know about? None of the other bridesmaids seem as confused as I am since no one's asking any of those questions and they all seem to know what to do. I don't really know any of them so I'm honestly shy/ashamed to ask. I just don't want to make a fool of myself so I figured I'd ask for advice online.

,NoStupidQuestions,"This is something I feel like I see every time the old ""hygiene Olympics"" topic comes around. Inevitably someone will claim ""if your shower takes less than X minutes you probably stink"" or something like that, usually ""X"" is 10 or 15 minutes or so. 

I genuinely don't get where this mindset comes from. I guess the idea is that if you're taking short showers, you must be skipping something or not cleaning well, but I don't think that's true.  

In college I had a busier schedule and started having to take faster showers, so I started timing myself with music. Today I can take a full shower, including shampoo &amp; conditioner, washing my face, washing the rest of my body (including all the debated areas like behind the ears, neck, armpits, butt, legs, feet, in between toes, etc) in under 10 minutes, consistently. I use Arm &amp; Hammer bodywash with a washcloth for my body and an anti-acne fashwash with my hands for my face. I have short hair now but had shoulder length for a while and that didn't add much time to my showers, as the bulk of hair washing for me (fine, straight hair) is massaging my scalp anyway. The only thing I don't do in the shower that some people might is shave my body and brush my teeth, but since those are things unrelated to the main shower task of washing yourself and/or can be done outside of the shower, I feel like they shouldn't be included when discussing shower length in this context. I'm pretty certain I don't stink, I currently live with my partner and they have never had any complaints, neither has my family or friends or coworkers etc. 

So, can someone enlighten me? I can't figure out why some people think it's impossible to take a thorough shower in this time. I've come up with a few possible ideas but none of these things feel like they can fully explain this phenomenon.

1. I'm pretty flexible so I can reach everywhere on my back, legs, etc with just my hands &amp; a washcloth. I guess if I needed to use a long handled brush to reach my back or something it might add like, another 30 seconds to switch from washcloth to brush?

2. I am 5'6"" and 130 lbs so I could see my showers being naturally a little quicker than someone who has more surface area on their body. Again, though, it feels like if I was bigger it would not take more than an extra minute or so to scrub the additional skin. 

3. Other various factors that might apply to some people, but wouldn't apply to everyone, like having differing physical abilities or an extensive hairwashing routine. But once again those seem sort of outside the original point of ""it's impossible to be fully clean if your shower is less than 10 minutes"".

I feel like this is a somewhat commonly held opinion, as I see it come up nearly as often as the ""do you wash your legs"" debate and always by different people.

Is there something I'm missing? A crucial step in the shower that everyone does but me but no one ever talks about? Or are some people just talking out their ass and can't comprehend that just bc they like to take their sweet time in the shower, doesn't mean it takes everyone else 30 full minutes to wash themselves?

&lt;p&gt;Should I call the vet to inform them that she passed? She doesn’t have any appointments coming up that I need to cancel, but I’m wondering if vets like to keep a record of that sort of thing?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also have leftover meds in the fridge that I will no longer be needing (antibiotics, pain meds etc). Is it alright to throw the remaining meds away (a pretty small amount) or should I contact the vet to see how to dispose of them? I also have some unopened meds - is it possible they might be able to reuse them?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thanks in advance!&lt;/p&gt;

,NoStupidQuestions,"I had a weird interaction today, and the only thing I can think of is it might be some kind of insurance scam:

I was behind traffic at a red light waiting to turn right. Several people turn on red, but the car ahead of me (a BMW) does not move forward in the lane. I thought maybe they were having car problems. The light turns green, and the driver gets out and walks up to my car. They say their car has registered an accident and has taken a picture of my car, but they “didn’t feel anything.” They then tell me I “might want to be careful.” They emphasize they now have a picture of my license plate. They go back to their car and drive off without asking me for my info or giving me theirs.

By the time I thought it might be a good idea to get at least a pic of their plate, they are already gone. It was such a weird interaction. I was stopped a safe distance behind, nowhere close enough to even slightly bump their car. If their camera was being stupid, why would they get out and talk to me? I did end up filing a police report just so I have a record in case the driver tries to make a claim against me at a later date or say I did a hit and run since they kept emphasizing they had my plate information.

,NoStupidQuestions,"Hey guys, I've always been pretty obtuse when it comes to picking up on non-verbal cues from women, even into adulthood.

There's a girl at my work. We've spoken before in a group setting a couple of times in the smoking area, but never one on one.

I've noticed that when I am delivering stock to her area of work that I often catch her staring at me when she thinks I haven't noticed, but when I look up in her direction she quickly looks away, but then, sure enough as soon as I go back to my work, she's looking in my direction again, this usually happens 3-4 times before im done with my task and I'm back on my way to do my next job.

I've often thought about playfully saying something playful along the lines on ""caught you that time"" or ""why don't you take a picture"" but I work in a busy factory and it would be disastrous if I've misread the situation, plus I don't want to embarrass her in front of her colleagues.

There was also one time where me, her, and another guy were talking in the smoke area, I've finished my smoke and gotten up to go back to work and I heard her say ""Oh, you're tall"", but my back was turned and the other dude is about the same height so I don't know if she was referring to me or him.

,NoStupidQuestions,"There is somebody at work that I'd like to ask out on a date, but I feel like you guys need to read the backstory below before telling me if it's a bad idea.

We are both doctors (MDs) in a \~70 person residency program at an academic hospital in the Northeast US. I am one of the senior residents and she is one of the first year residents that started in July 2024. As such, there is a power imbalance. I don't have the authority to fire her / do anything to her disciplinary-wise, but when we are on a team together caring for the same patients she does have to listen to what I have to say. When we are not working together, I'll likely see her almost every day, but that power imbalance is not really there. The very last day that she and I will be working together on a team (and thus I have direct power over her) is September 29. At the end of our shift together on September 29, I'd like to ask her out for drinks or coffee.

From September 30, 2024 to June 30, 2025, she will still be a first-year resident and I will still technically have power over her but not really since we won't be directly working with each other again. She becomes a senior resident on July 1, 2025 and at that point this power imbalance will no longer be present whatsoever. I graduate from the residency program on June 30, 2026. She graduates from the residency program on June 30, 2027.

Because of the power dynamic, I am worried that she will feel like she cannot say no when she most certainly can say no. I realize that if this goes poorly that we will still be required to see each other almost every day until the end of June 2026; this isn't a job that one of us can just walk away from. I do not think either of us would allow it to become awkward at work if things were to not work out, but I know I can only speak for myself in that regard. I don't want her to feel uncomfortable at work and yet still have to show up and see me every day.

We do text back-and-forth somewhat regularly, and it seems somewhat flirtatious (a lot of emoji use, extra letters, etc.), but I understand that could also be friendliness. Whenever we talk in person, there is usually some subtle touching of arms, shoulders, etc. on both sides. Whenever she sees me in a group of people, we link eyes and she will smile and wave to me and me alone.

Without telling them who I was talking about, I did discuss this with several of my other co-senior residents a few nights ago, and every single one of them (both men and women) said that I should just go for it. They don't want me to come into work every day and think ""what if...?""

I know the classic saying ""don't shit where you eat,"" but I legitimately feel like I cannot take that saying seriously. Prior to dating apps, I feel like work was one of the most common places that people would start a relationship. There are also several residents in our program that are dating (or engaged or married), but all of these relationships started prior to them starting at the program. My parents also met in the 1980s in a residency program where my dad had authority over my mom, and that situation turned out great.

,NoStupidQuestions,"Hello beautiful people.

I have a random question relating to the most energy efficient way to walk up stairs.

When I walk up stairs, I will typically go for the ""double step method"". Rather than stepping on each step, I will skip a step, so only using every second step. This gets up up the stairs faster than if I had used every step, however, it obviously uses more energy each step as I am having to work harder for each step. So, I am using more energy per step, but I am reducing the amount of steps I take by half.

If there is a stair case of 20 steps, I could use each step at a lower energy output, or I can use 10 steps, with a higher energy output.

What is the most energy efficient way to climb this lovely staircase of 20 steps?

I’ve noticed it’s always after I take a long time to respond.

I don’t get it bc he’s the one trying to take things further.Then again I check my msgs and don’t bother responding to ppl if I’m busy doing stuff incl hobbies. Mostly bc I just don’t have the energy to respond to everyone tbh. 

&amp;nbsp;

We got a bit carried away on our first date and he tried to give me head. I told him I didn’t want anything physical and he said he respected my decision and that the sex didn’t matter to him. Main thing that threw me off was that he told me he loved me after only meeting once prior and talking for like 2 weeks. Not sure if he’s the type to fall easily or he’s live bombing me tbh. Other than that he’s been very sweet so far. I rlly like him but I’m cautious getting attached to him. I tend to make excuses for ppls actions tho so I want an outsider’s perspective.


&amp;nbsp;

Idk if it matters but we met at a concert. He left early. A long time goes by and this guy started dancing all up on me. This girl came to my rescue and she asked me if i knew the guy I was talking to. I said no and she told me to avoid him bc he was up to no good.

,NoStupidQuestions,"Hello all,

I’m a 22 year old man who is thinking about possible outcomes that may end up happening in my life. I am a single with no kids so I feel like I don’t have too much to worry about right now. I also have good family support too, my family has taken me back with open arms to live back with them (rent free) to focus on school and getting another job.

I’ve been thinking about what I really WANT from life. I think to myself when I’m laying on my deathbed what is something that I wouldn’t change. At the end of the day it would be having a family of my own and raising them to be good and functioning members of society and in hopes that they are able to carry on doing the same thing.

I think without saying though that I’d have to build a good foundation first. Starting a family with nothing to my name doesn’t sound like a good idea logically. I can already feel the financial burdens and struggle just typing it out.

First thing that comes to mind is getting a house. As messed up as the housing market is, I feel like it is important to have a home to raise a family. So I’ve been starting a fund to go into a home. I’m still pretty iffy on location but I feel like Texas would be a good bet. Not only because of housing but there is plenty of job opportunities out there and I’d imagine there would be things to do for fun. Now my idea of fun is different from others. I am more of a homebody. Like to play video games, watch movies, play some sports and work on cars. Traveling is one of those things where it is cool but I don’t really care for it unless I’m going with a group of close friends. I more so remember the time spent with people than the actual location. I digress 

Second thing I want is an important piece in starting a family and that is finding the right woman to start with. I don’t like to play games on this. I feel like people should have a partner that compliments them, while also having life goals that align with each-other. Now here is where I may start to lose people. While you may find a person that is right for you in a certain time in your life that doesnt necessarily mean they will be right for you later on. We are human, our feeling can change. My feelings can change/her feelings can change. Though, I may want to work things out, she might not want to or vice versa. Which is why I want to prepare for the worst. When/If marriage is in the talks I will bring up getting a prenuptial agreement. If either me or my significant other got a divorce both our assets need to be protected from it. I’d try everything in my power to not get the prenup nulled but if it fails then it fails worst case-scenario.

Third thing I have been thinking about is dependent on the length of the marriage. I use to think alimony was a sham that benefited women but WHAT IF she agreed to not work in order to hold it down at home and take care of the kid/kids. She put her whole life on pause to do that. Time is money, which is why I’m leaning on potentially making a fund for alimony too for the duration of the marriage just in case. If I am married I’d start saving about maybe 20% of my monthly income and put that somewhere in the event it does happen. I’m hoping I could use that towards a settlement or something in case it does happen.

If non of these issues happen then great, if it does then at least I’d be a bit prepared for it.

Worse Case-Scenario: Divorced, Assets taken, Alimony and Child Support

Better Case-Scenario: Divorced, Protected Assets, Alimony and Child Support

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not sure if this is the way..  because my core is really engaging.  Like I&amp;#39;m bracing my core for when someone punches me in my stomach.   I&amp;#39;ve been trying for 3 days now, and my abs are sore.&lt;br/&gt;
Maybe my core is that weak and I have a lot of work to do? (Even though I&amp;#39;m pretty strong/weightlifting)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is your core engaged naturally when you&amp;#39;re just standing up?   &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I know you&amp;#39;re not doctors but.. due to huge anxiety issues it&amp;#39;s really hard for me to leave the house and see a doctor or a specialist..  so if I can simply fix it myself then I&amp;#39;d choose that option). &lt;/p&gt;

So i (23) just never actually explored my own sexuality as myself. i'm a maladaptive daydreamer, so my entire experience with ""my"" sexuality was through these characters. Outside of that, sex for me sounded awkward and kinda gross.

However, months ago, i gained a friend (M23) who became my first crush blah, blah, blah. Anyway, it went from not feeling sexually attracted to him at all to very rarely having those thoughts about him to... i don't know. These past few days, i've been really sick and, TMI, i've never felt this ""strongly"" (about an actual person) in my life. it's distracting, annoying, and confusing. In a fantasy, one idea would sound really fun to me, but when my mind is less clouded by lust, it just isn't anymore. i hate the lack of consistency, is this normal? Will there be a time when i know what i want or is it that things sound worse in practice than in your mind a part of having a sexuality?

,NoStupidQuestions,"For me, the most dominant tenet of the red-pill/black-pill school of thought was the 80/20 rule; the idea that, at least when it comes down to casual sex and pure physical attraction, that 80% of women go for the top 20% of men.

To me, this was the tenet that was the most impactful; I simply gave up on dating for a number of years because of this belief. I cannot remember the last time I approached a woman and tried to talk to her in the context of trying to cultivate a romantic/sexual connection. I came to believe that women were only *truly* physically attracted to a handful of men, and that the raw physical attraction that women have is only reserved for a select few men. I came to believe that the glamorous world of hookups, FWB's, flings, etc, were simply out of reach for an average-at-best looking guy like me.

I never had any resentment towards women because of this belief, nor did I have any jealousy towards the supposed top 20% of men. I simply shrugged my shoulders, swallowed my feelings of inadequacy, accepted my ""fate"" in this supposed hierarchy, and decided to be content with porn and my right hand. I chose to view the 80/20 rule as simply a fact of life, like gravity, and move on. I never devolved into the antisocial, society-hating, borderline psychotic lifestyle of the incels. I would also like to note that little else of the red-pill dogma ever really impacted me; I have never cared about a woman's ""body count"", or her age, or the other superficial ways that the red-pill tends to judge women.

The 80/20 rule seems to be fairly prominent in spaces even outside the red-pill domain. Quite a few feminists, for example, seem to parrot this theory; unlike their red-pill/black-pill counterparts, they view this as a good thing rather than bemoaning it. Many evolutionary psychologists parrot some version of this theory as well, and view it merely as an unavoidable fact of nature, something that is neither a good or bad thing, but simply the law of male and female mating.

Another closely related theory prominent in the red-pill space is the ""dual-mating strategy"" theory; the idea that women *solely* seek out the top 20% of men to satisfy their raw sexual desires during their younger (18-30) years, and that, once they hit a certain age and are looking for a long term relationship, decide to ""settle"" with an average looking man who can provide them with some level of financial stability (assuming that they are unable to land one of the top 20% of men for a long term relationship). In these relationships, according to the red pill, the women have no real sexual attraction to the men they are with; rather, they simply trade sex with them in exchange for financial stability and a roof over their head. The sex is effectively contractual; the ""relationship"" is little more than prostitution.

Because of this theory, I never tried to get into a long term relationship. The idea of being the ""safe option"" for someone is not flattering, to say the least.

Even if I didn't believe this theory though, I don't want to get into a long term relationship. I don't want to get into something long term simply as a last resort to getting laid; if I were ever to get into a long-term relationship with someone, I would want it to be because I truly love them and choose to be with them, *even if* I could sleep around with other women. In my opinion, choosing a sole partner even when you have the option of sleeping around with others is true love, and is the true test of loyalty in a relationship.

I have come here today to ask you all two questions:

1. *Is the 80/20 theory true?*

It seems that the red-pill advocates have an endless supply of studies which prove their beliefs, and a lot of these studies are pretty convincing. Evolutionary psychologists also have a lot of study and data behind them to prove this theory.

Are there any studies that disprove the 80/20 rule? Are there any well known dating coaches/sexologists/researchers who have disproven the 80/20 rule?

*2) Assuming that the 80/20 rule* ***is*** *true, what do I do next?*

If the 80/20 rule is true, as I am very inclined to believe it is, what are my next steps, in terms of sex and dating?

As I mentioned before, I am NOT ready to get into a long term relationship. A long term relationship, in my opinion, is supposed to be for people who *choose* to be with each other even if they have the option to sleep around. Ideally, the people who seek out something long term are those who have gotten all of their hookups and flings out of their system, in a manner of speaking. As you can probably guess, I am *not* one of those people. The idea of getting into a long term relationship simply as a last resort to get laid and not be alone disgusts me, to tell you the truth. The hypothetical woman in this ""relationship"" would deserve better. She would deserve much better. And if I were in such a relationship, all I would be asking myself most of the time would be ""Am I truly loyal to this woman, or am I only loyal to her because she's my only available option?"".

So if I cannot be in a long term relationship, and if casual encounters are out of reach for me, what are my next steps? What should my outlook towards sex and dating be?",t2_17ik9gm59d,False,,0,False,How does one go about sex and dating after being steeped in red-pill ideology for so long?,[],r/NoStupidQuestions,False,6,,0,,False,t3_1f7tjdm,False,dark,0.29,,public,0,0,{},,False,[],,False,False,,{},,False,0,,False,False,,False,,[],{},,True,,1725346682.0,text,6,,,text,self.NoStupidQuestions,False,"&lt;!-- SC_OFF --&gt;&lt;div class=""md""&gt;&lt;p&gt;For me, the most dominant tenet of the red-pill/black-pill school of thought was the 80/20 rule; the idea that, at least when it comes down to casual sex and pure physical attraction, that 80% of women go for the top 20% of men.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To me, this was the tenet that was the most impactful; I simply gave up on dating for a number of years because of this belief. I cannot remember the last time I approached a woman and tried to talk to her in the context of trying to cultivate a romantic/sexual connection. I came to believe that women were only &lt;em&gt;truly&lt;/em&gt; physically attracted to a handful of men, and that the raw physical attraction that women have is only reserved for a select few men. I came to believe that the glamorous world of hookups, FWB&amp;#39;s, flings, etc, were simply out of reach for an average-at-best looking guy like me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I never had any resentment towards women because of this belief, nor did I have any jealousy towards the supposed top 20% of men. I simply shrugged my shoulders, swallowed my feelings of inadequacy, accepted my &amp;quot;fate&amp;quot; in this supposed hierarchy, and decided to be content with porn and my right hand. I chose to view the 80/20 rule as simply a fact of life, like gravity, and move on. I never devolved into the antisocial, society-hating, borderline psychotic lifestyle of the incels. I would also like to note that little else of the red-pill dogma ever really impacted me; I have never cared about a woman&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;body count&amp;quot;, or her age, or the other superficial ways that the red-pill tends to judge women.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 80/20 rule seems to be fairly prominent in spaces even outside the red-pill domain. Quite a few feminists, for example, seem to parrot this theory; unlike their red-pill/black-pill counterparts, they view this as a good thing rather than bemoaning it. Many evolutionary psychologists parrot some version of this theory as well, and view it merely as an unavoidable fact of nature, something that is neither a good or bad thing, but simply the law of male and female mating.&lt;/p&gt;

In these relationships, according to the red pill, the women have no real sexual attraction to the men they are with; rather, they simply trade sex with them in exchange for financial stability and a roof over their head. The sex is effectively contractual; the &amp;quot;relationship&amp;quot; is little more than prostitution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of this theory, I never tried to get into a long term relationship. The idea of being the &amp;quot;safe option&amp;quot; for someone is not flattering, to say the least.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if I didn&amp;#39;t believe this theory though, I don&amp;#39;t want to get into a long term relationship.

&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Is the 80/20 theory true?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;2) Assuming that the 80/20 rule&lt;/em&gt; &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;em&gt;true, what do I do next?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
