ll8p1vf,IvyCaitlin,"It's astonishing that in the age of medical advancements, where we can transplant organs and map the human genome, we still struggle with recognizing and adequately addressing women's pain. The trivialization of these symptoms is profoundly rooted in a historical bias that discounts female pain as overreaction or hysteria. This perspective can dangerously delay diagnoses for conditions like endometriosis, which isn't just ""bad periods"" but a serious, sometimes debilitating condition. Moreover, the ""grin and bear it"" mantra women have been taught only serves to perpetuate a cycle of silence and suffering. Our pain is real, our experiences are valid, and it‚Äôs high time the medical community, and society as a whole, acknowledge this truth and act on it.",88

ll8d8am,Dissabilitease,"Diagnosed endometriosis and chronic pain. They're not the same *to me*, but please let me explain.

By no means do I intend to downplay or invalidate the pain of debilitating menstrual cycles. I live folded at the hips for 50% of my life.

But the chronic pain is so much more than one pain that decided to stay. Your whole pain perception changes, called central sensitisation. For example, my body feels under extreme threat when it's below 20 degrees celcius (68F) and shuts all unnecessary functions (like digestion) off because it thinks it needs to go into survival mode. A gentle touch while having goosebumps feels like being skinned. And so much more. And it's *24/7.*

Pain is sooo subjective. My chronic pain is NOT worse than someone's endometriosis, that's not how a body's pain perception works. Your worst pain will always be that: the worst! And any kind of constant pain and discomfort needs to be treated with absolute validation and not downplayed in comparison.",93

ll8nr21,Actual_Humor4906,"When I was 34 I woke up in the middle of the night feeling like there was an elephant sitting on my chest. I knew immediately I was having a heart attack. 

I still took the time to look up heart attack symptoms because I thought I was too young before I called 911. 

Ambulance came and took me to the ‚Äúleading‚Äù heart hospital in my area. 

Because I have a history of mental illness; when the initial testing came back negative for a cardiac infarction the attending physician ordered a psych evaluation. 
No one believed me when I kept repeating, ‚Äú I know I‚Äôm crazy, but I‚Äôm not crazy about this. Something is wrong with my heart.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt a threat to myself or anyone else so they prescribed me some Xanax and recommended I schedule some therapy and sent me home. 

I ate that shit. Hoping for some relief. Had a friend babysit my kids and spent the night on my parents‚Äô couch. I didn‚Äôt sleep. The elephant was still sitting on my chest. 

The next morning I begged my mom to take me back to the ER. She didn‚Äôt want to. Because my life at that time was particularly stressful she believed that I just needed to check myself into a psych ward. I sobbed to my dad again that I knew I was crazy but I wasn‚Äôt crazy about this. She ended up taking me to an immediate care clinic. 

That doctor diagnosed me with an inflamed chest wall, prescribed me anti-inflammatories, heating pads and hot showers. 

Two days later my roommate begged me to go back to the hospital because I was gray and could barely get off the couch. I was terrified of being labeled crazy again and getting placed on a 72 hour hold. 

Turns out one of my arteries was 100% blocked. 

I later learned that women can have heart attack symptoms long before they have the infarction. The original doctor should have held me for at least 24 hours and repeated the test. 

And that‚Äôs just one of many stories I have with medical issues. 

All that to say, if I can‚Äôt get doctors to believe I‚Äôm having a heart attack, why could I get them to believe I was curled in the fetal position 2-3 days out of every month.",50

When I got to the doctor I was told my options were ""take birth control until menopause"" or ""get a hysterectomy"".

ll8ln3d,Alycion,"If it‚Äôs from endometriosis, I hate to tell you, it may never go away. It‚Äôs not as bad now. I haven‚Äôt had a period since my early 30‚Äôs due to other issues. I dealt with pain in between periods from endometriosis. Last week I felt like I had those good ol‚Äô cramps back. Happens about twice a year.  OBGYN who specializes in this condition said it can happen bc of where my growth always was. Right along the nerves. All of my doctors considered it chronic pain. It‚Äôs not considered a disability bc they figure we can plan around it. And that‚Äôs bc guys don‚Äôt have to deal with this and they are the ones who make these sorts of decisions. Until females are the ones making the decisions, some people will never take it seriously. Any pain, even if common, is not normal. It is a sign something is wrong. It may not be serious. It may just be muscle cramping based on the changes our body undergoes through our cycle. 

I have lupus, bipolar, and a list of other issues that could fill a medical journal. There are times I can not walk. I still went all of the way to a hearing. I had a woman judge who said I‚Äôm going to have you take me through a good day, a bad day and a normal day after asking about how many of each I had a month. We started with bad day. I have at least 15 a month. She stopped me two sentences in, went on a tangent about how it wasn‚Äôt approved the first time. My lawyer told me most of their clients are female bc the system takes us less seriously. And I‚Äôve noticed when trying to get diagnosed, that seems to be the answer.

With endometriosis it was even worse. I started at 11, day 1 of my first period with symptoms. An er visit at 18 started the ball rolling on a diagnosis. Treatment was refused by insurance. It took me collapsing at work in pain, the medical reported getting me in with one of the best in the world who was at the jones institute at the time, and him threatening my new insurance for me to get my first surgery and birth control covered. The lecture panel of who decided whether to cover something that wasn‚Äôt normally covered unless medically necessary was men.",7

ll8wibm,TesseractToo,"This got crossposted to r/chronicpain so I'm pasting my reply here:

It's intermittent pain, it's still awful and needs care

The difference is that with chronic pain is after 3 months of nonstop pain, there are physical changes in the brain structure from the unrelenting pain

With menstrual pain it's only there for mensuration so the brain gets a break.

This isn't downplaying the severity or seriousness of it

edit: I think in some cases like endometriosis it is considered chronic but episodic

Also bear in mind that all pain in woman is downplayed so its hard for episodic especially menstrual pain to be taken seriously, doubly so for PoC

Also edit edit: My chronic migraine is literally all of the time and it's severe, on the 11th it will be 38 years since my injury. I get this is a cross post but let's try to not overgeneralize in support subs please",10

ll980v2,Usual-Percentage-309,"I believe I understand your point, but you are comparing apples to oranges a bit.¬†


For one, with my chronic headache and chronic migraine diagnoses, the number of days per month is taken into account. Chronic is 15 days or more a month and episodic is 3 to 15 days per month.¬†


Also, sometimes the same terminology is used for a primary disorder and a symptom. For example, I also have chronic insomnia which could either be a symptom of my chronic headaches and migraine or a separate disorder. I believe pain would be considered a symptom of a reproductive disorder like PCOS or endometriosis. In the case, you wouldn't have chronic pain as a disorder. Pain as a symptom still needs to be taken seriously and addressed.¬†


Another commenter already noted this, but your take on chronic migraine was very dismissive. People with chronic migraine do literally have migraine all the time. Some do not have migraine attacks every day, but our brains have migraine disorder all the time; our brains experience the world through the differences in our brains, and many, like me, have symptoms ever day.


I get the impression that you are frustrated that you don't get the recognition you deserve for the pain associated with your condition and perhaps feel dismissed. It's not right for you to be treated that way. It's also not right for you to be dismissive of people with a different diagnosis than yours. This isn't a competition.",5
