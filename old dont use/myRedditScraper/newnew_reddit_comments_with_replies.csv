Always very painful, always very heavy (to the point I needed blood transfusions a few times)! I haven't had them for, I really can't remember when they stopped....it was after I was told to stop taking the pill, so 4 maybe 5 years. It's because of my screwed up endocrine system. I am glad I don't have them anymore. I empathise greatly with every single female that has to go through the whole gamut in menstruation. Pain, bleeding, mood changes, nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, fainting, migraines and all the other symptoms that go along with a period. Women need to be treated so much better with regards to healthcare. If anything, we put up with and can tolerate more pain than a male so if we do say something then it is a big deal. Drs, specialists, stop treating women like we're hysterical, moody and looking for attention. I hope everyone is well as can be and happy today. Peace and love from Australia ü¶òü•∞",3

By no means do I intend to downplay or invalidate the pain of debilitating menstrual cycles. I live folded at the hips for 50% of my life.

But the chronic pain is so much more than one pain that decided to stay. Your whole pain perception changes, called central sensitisation. For example, my body feels under extreme threat when it's below 20 degrees celcius (68F) and shuts all unnecessary functions (like digestion) off because it thinks it needs to go into survival mode. A gentle touch while having goosebumps feels like being skinned. And so much more. And it's *24/7.*

Pain is sooo subjective. My chronic pain is NOT worse than someone's endometriosis, that's not how a body's pain perception works. Your worst pain will always be that: the worst! And any kind of constant pain and discomfort needs to be treated with absolute validation and not downplayed in comparison.",87

I still took the time to look up heart attack symptoms because I thought I was too young before I called 911. 

Ambulance came and took me to the ‚Äúleading‚Äù heart hospital in my area. 

Because I have a history of mental illness; when the initial testing came back negative for a cardiac infarction the attending physician ordered a psych evaluation. 
No one believed me when I kept repeating, ‚Äú I know I‚Äôm crazy, but I‚Äôm not crazy about this. Something is wrong with my heart.‚Äù

I wasn‚Äôt a threat to myself or anyone else so they prescribed me some Xanax and recommended I schedule some therapy and sent me home. 

I ate that shit. Hoping for some relief. Had a friend babysit my kids and spent the night on my parents‚Äô couch. I didn‚Äôt sleep. The elephant was still sitting on my chest. 

The next morning I begged my mom to take me back to the ER. She didn‚Äôt want to. Because my life at that time was particularly stressful she believed that I just needed to check myself into a psych ward. I sobbed to my dad again that I knew I was crazy but I wasn‚Äôt crazy about this. She ended up taking me to an immediate care clinic. 

That doctor diagnosed me with an inflamed chest wall, prescribed me anti-inflammatories, heating pads and hot showers. 

Two days later my roommate begged me to go back to the hospital because I was gray and could barely get off the couch. I was terrified of being labeled crazy again and getting placed on a 72 hour hold. 

Turns out one of my arteries was 100% blocked. 

I later learned that women can have heart attack symptoms long before they have the infarction. The original doctor should have held me for at least 24 hours and repeated the test. 

And that‚Äôs just one of many stories I have with medical issues.

I need to be in a dark room, with little to no noise, no strong smells, ac/fans blasting, eyes closed/eye mask on, with a heating pad on my head. I normally get 1-3 migraines per month; a single episode can have me completely out of commission for 1-2 days, with residual effects lasting another couple of days. Occasionally it goes on for longer‚Äî I‚Äôve gone weeks at a time where I‚Äôm in pain/out of it to some degree every single day.

You obviously understand all of that as a fellow migraine sufferer. But it drives me crazy when people dismiss migraines because they don‚Äôt understand what it actually means to have one.",9
ll8wucu,ll8w8ba,kiskadee321,Yeah. That totally makes sense. Sorry you have so much pain. üôÅ,4

llabi3o,ll8e15x,lynx_and_nutmeg,"OP's point was that in order for a condition to be considered chronic you don't need to have the symptoms literally 24/7 365 days a year. Disability is a spectrum. No two people with the same disability or health condition are going to have exactly the same experiences or the same severity and frequency of symptoms. If the only argument for extremely painful periods is that women only have a period for a few days a month, then that's definitely not enough. I only have a pollen allergy for about 6 weeks every year but it's still technically a chronic health condition because it's lifelong and recurring.",2
llb0j5a,llabi3o,maybeshesmelting,"And op tried to make their point by making (false) blanket statements that downplay other conditions.

Op could have effectively made their point by simply describing the ways in which periods can be debilitating, but no, they chose to go down the ‚Äúmigraines aren‚Äôt that bad‚Äù path instead.",2

ll9ys7v,ll93aii,ArminOak,"This is most likely the correct answer. Women are under appriciated and they have often seen as 2nd class humans. Sure motherhood is some what appreciated, because it serves men with offsprings, thats sabout it. But change does happen. Slowly, but surely!",5

Never underestimate how deep the misogyny of our culture goes.",5
ll9c9ga,,ReflexiveOW,"So everyone is essentially throwing themselves a virtue signaling party in here and not actually giving you the real actual current reason. 

Menstrual pain isn't considered chronic because it only occurs during a woman's period, as opposed to being an every day pain, it also varies in severity for most women, some months are ok, some months they can barely walk. That's why it isn't treated as chronic pain.",6

even sadder, female doctors make this mistake as well.",2

I'm in my 29th year of this bullshit, and I'm only 40. So I'm likely to suffer through this for at least another five years.",2
llaz11q,,Preemptively_Extinct,It's not usually chronic. Chronic means it doesn't stop. If you aren't getting breaks between periods it's not period pain and you should be looking for a better doctor.,2
llb1h3a,,junegloome776,"Chiming in as someone else that does have chronic migraines ""all day all the time"" everyone's migraines are different, don't speak on something you clearly don't know about. You don't like people being dismissive about crippling menstrual pain (and I say this as someone who also experiences that), don't be dismissive of others crippling pain that you haven't experienced before.",2

And the reason is the same as the reason for most bad stuff in women's medicine: sexism, dog.  Just good old fashioned ""we don't talk about lady parts and we never do any research on women"".  A lot about women's experience in medicine is basically invisible.  There's whole books on this subject.",1

ll8sz3g,,orygun66,"Severe debilitating menstrual cramps are how I got started with my pain meds. My primary had me try morphine. I can't take anti-inflammatories because I take coumadin. It worked OK, but it wasn't enough when I was diagnosed with adenomyosis, endometrial tissue exists within and grows into the uterine wall. So my primary had me start a fentanyl patch 12 hours per day during my period. That helped a great deal. Somewhere in all of that my gynecologist gave me Dilaudid to try. Those were the days. 13 years ago. Sigh. So I totally agree. It certainly should be chronic pain. Someone needs to push that one. But dang, doctors don't want to medicate for major issues.",1
ll8y25x,,bigfatkitty2006,"I get menstrual migraines and severe cramps. I'm 3 decades in and probably have another one or so to go.  I have FMLA on file for the migraines. But never tried for cramps, only because they always synced up with the migraines. But fully agree!",1

Sure sucks, because usually it‚Äôs an underlying problem such as pcos, endometriosis, ovarian cysts. But if they don‚Äôt check those then it‚Äôs likely considered normal - as the uterus contacts with to shed which can cause cramps, literally it‚Äôs contracting. Idk man just some info here",1
