lley5j0,,Thefunincaifun,"&gt;‚ÄúThe victim was the one who abused my client. The victim was trying to agitate my client on the day of the incident. He was deliberately trying to annoy my client out of the house,‚Äù the lawyer said.

Victim annoyed my client by switching off the WiF, so it's reasonable for the client to use a flamethrower and chopper on the victim /s",51
llfb295,lley5j0,awstream,There is already someone in this thread who feels this way but without the /s,1
