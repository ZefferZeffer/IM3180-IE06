ll5f362,,fonduelazone,I miss the outlet at Centrepoint with the huge outdoor seating area as well as the one at YMCA where you could eat after going to the old National Library at Stamford Road.,28
ll5nil8,ll5f362,Bcpjw,The ad kind of captures the nostalgia of traveling to town to eat Mac even though not exactly but the highlight of going to town is the happy meal box & free toy after watching back to the future,17
ll954qg,ll5f362,BoGumWan,"Nostalgic indeed. Going to town every other Saturday, enjoying the ""free smell"" at Specialist shopping centre while my mum had her facial. Then to Robinsons and Cold Storage after. If lucky, a quick stop at McDonald's for a small ice cream treat (I remember it came in a plastic container with a lid back then?).",3
ll9y0a0,ll954qg,fonduelazone,"I remember buying Famous Amos at Specialists' Shopping Centre while my mum shopped at John Little, it was a weekly treat for me and my bro.",3
ll67kjl,,musicmast,how did singaporean creativity regress so much in 30 years,22
lla69yi,ll67kjl,KeenStudent,Our national day songs epitomize your point. Im gonna say it. Late 90s and 2000s were the best.,3
llez4wc,ll67kjl,Ok-Carpet-3520,"Well.. the relationship between creativity in advertising and societal sensitivities is indeed complex and evolving. In recent years, there has been an increased awareness and sensitivity to issues of inclusivity and respect. Advertisers need to navigate these sensitivities carefully to avoid crossing lines that could be deemed offensive. In this case, they deemed that mcdonalds food is unhealthy so...yea. ü§∑üèª",0

ll99jpb,ll67kjl,VexingPanda,"The same fate around the world., I would say it's more of the impact in the past ten years. Use the algorithm direction style that converts and throw creativity out the window.",-4
ll5awpz,,kwpang,"Oh dick lee.

I thought it was mackenyu for a second, until I checked the sub name.

Then it got all the more confusing. Mackengu is not that old, and he doesn't do Singapore ads.",40
ll5mp78,ll5awpz,Bcpjw,His jacket is so king of pop! Lol,6
ll6l59q,ll5awpz,ssss861,Calling Dick Mackenyu is the greatest compliment.,5
llbaxsr,ll5awpz,Prize_Used,man he's pretty handsome back in the days...the first few seconds of the video i thought it was kimura takuya,2
ll5bctm,,feizhai,nostalgia attack! i wonder if the fries then were still fried in beef tallow? McRib still around? Durian shake?,11
ll60f7h,,LMJR500Army,Brings back some nostalgia even though from the early 2000s. Still rmb the yellow & red seats that sometimes were a bit too tiny to sit on. And the iconic Ronald Mcdonald statue sitting on a bench outside the outlet. Mannn rush of memories from childhood,9
llfa3t7,ll60f7h,Repulsive_Cookie7159,Later I learned that the uncomfortable chair were designed on purpose so that customers will not sit long .But it does not work for me in 1990s as a teenager.,1
ll639vb,,NIDORAX,"This advertisement is a timecapsule of Singapore in the early 1990s. Look at all those 1990s fashion, cars and old school 1990s McDonalds! I do remember seeing this advertisement on TV once when I was a kid.",11
ll6cbxe,ll639vb,AidilAfham42,And kids are now sporting this hair and wearing baggy clothes like its the 90‚Äôs. We‚Äôre now ‚Äúretro‚Äù ü•≤,6
ll8hlts,ll6cbxe,I_love_pillows,"I was in a party and DJ my age (30s) started to play some late 90s Eurodance remix. And me seeing 18 year olds dance to it, alongside 30 year olds. And thinking the song hits differently for these 2 groups.",3
llaad4l,ll6cbxe,Krazyguylone,"I wouldn‚Äôt want the cars to go retro hahah, new cars are so much more nicer to drive with lane assist, blind spot checking, carplay/android auto (seriously radio sucks).",1
ll5qmdl,,2ddudesop,"aww this is super cute. love the mrt reference lol, so singaporean",4
ll5i3kr,,hc___Ps,"too bad most singaporeans memory are pretty short term

this might considered as lost media",10
ll84ige,,Specific-Photo261,My brother was in one of the ads from this era when they were promoting chicken nuggets. I was super young then but I remember him having a good time. And he still LOVES nuggets lol,2
ll89jb9,,MerRyanSG,"This was quite good. 

The worst was when they got Zoe and Fann together - it was so fake obviously they were not on good terms but had to 'act'.",2
ll8kdb0,,accidentaleast,"Oh the nostalgia! This ad is really a vibe, just simple fun.",2
ll8lgot,,IgnisIncendio,Anyone have an Archive.org account to back this up?,2
ll8s1hg,ll8lgot,Tonywong_yay,"I'm planning to capture a direct feed from the VCR to get it in a higher quality before I upload it, currently just pointing my camera at the screen so still working on it",5
ll9y01n,,kangcore,"Anyone else remembers ""tomorrow going you know""?",2
llao2tl,,nicjude,"Boy, the good ol' days, when Mcdonald's was actually good and worth buying as a meal.",2
ll8ife3,,Wowmich,"Still remember the 1st Mcdonald open up in Singapore on Orchard road, opposite Lido",1
ll9dhqn,,Luo_Yi,"Since it was from the 90's I was half expecting them to mention, ""Limited Edition Hello Kitty Dollz"" (while supplies last)",1
ll9yv7p,,nirmalv,I love this ad...such a burst of nostalgia. The lack of imagination in current ads is mind blowing.,1
