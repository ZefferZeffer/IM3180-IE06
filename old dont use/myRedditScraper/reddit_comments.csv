1f6bte8,llazm3t,momopervd,"Non American here. I don't really understand **how voting by mail works** so I have a series of question about it.
Does the voting mail have a different collection system then regular mail? 
How do they make sure it isn't lost by mistake or on purpose? 
How do they ensure the vote stays secret? Is there the name of the sender on the envelope?
Is the mail opened before the election day or they keep closed untill then?",1
1f6bte8,llaoxwo,DullahanJake,"**Why the two party system, or this seemingly, commonly held belief that only those two parties can win so I should vote for one of them?**

Yes their odds might never seem high, but it feels like a self-fulfilling prophecy. ""*The third party never wins, my vote won't count if I vote for them because they won't win, so I'll vote for the 2 candidates who are likely to win, now the next time I vote there will be evidence saying the third party didn't win, my vote won't count if I vote for them because they won't win, so I'll vote for,* etc.""

I think people just internalize the idea that they should only go for the ""realistic/likely"" outcomes rather than standing by their actual desires for the Presidency. I know that whoever's in office can affect policies/things that allow you to live, but as we've seen in the last two administrations, people resist policies/federal mandates/pandemic guidelines they disagree with anyway. 

So hypothetically if you picked a third party and it didn't win, you would be resisting what the winning administration does anyway. How many people do you know who work off the books, or have a VPN or a Firestick, or break the law in some fashion, or hire undocumented workers, or move to places where abortion laws are less strict? Do you know any sanctuary cities? We reject the administration whenever the policies don't suit our moral codes literally all the time.

Like it baffles me. Say there are 3 doors.

* Door 1 will take you into a room with grizzly bears.
* Door 2 will take you into a room with bees.
* Door 3 you don't know what could be in there, but it isn't bears or bees.

Why in the f-ck would you talk yourself into picking any door other than the third one?

**Why are presidential campaigns so expensive and why would I give a dollar to any party?**

Republican/Democratic parties raise millions/billions so the candidate can travel around the country, do interviews and debates, make slam pieces about each other, fighting amongst their own group, and then drop out and endorse the person more likely to win in one of the most sickening displays of sycophancy I've ever seen. This election cycle I saw several people stand up to a guy who didn't even show up to the debate... and they all ended up dropping out and telling voters to go vote for that guy.

I feel incredibly un-patriotic, woe is me, but I hate that we spend so much time and money on this. At no point do I ever desire to offer even a cent to any of these people. I never go to rallies and I hate the traffic delays that happen in my state because of them. It's easier to watch them online for highlights. I do not understand why there needs to be a massive circus during election years around two people, all of this ceremony around people most of whom will drop out and endorse someone else, multi-person debates, etc. 

If we're supposed to make politicians/representatives work for us, I don't see why so many donate money to them for them to use every four Years. Ignoring the possibility of campaign finance fraud, I'm just talking from a moral standpoint - I get why *millionaires and billionaires* throw money at politics. The average blue-collar family though I wouldn't understand, especially during tax season; that time when those same politicians are wringing us for money we might owe them but hey if they owe us they'll let it slide.  

Like maybe I'm dumb, but it angers me that this is even an option I have to see when I pay my taxes.",0

Without women giving consistent birth, you don't have a supply of children to become new members of the group.  The steady supply of new believers, workers and soldiers you need to maintain your grip on power. It's why governments, like Japan for example, fears the birthing crisis.  It's the same reason every other conservative society wants women on lock down at home, and can have variety levels of threat behind it.  Like letting men get away with rape in many places by making it the woman's fault for going outside alone.


If a woman has the education to understand that the system around her is toxic and has the freedom to escape it, those in power lose the potential workers and soldiers they could have bred out of her.  They don't like that.  So they might claim it's for women's ""protection"" that they need to be monitored at all times by men and denied any form of education that might make them question this treatment.  But the truth is that they view women as a required resource to be exploited, not as human beings.  Especially since it takes a while for the children they have to become valuable to those in power, so for the Taliban, they used an immediate, violent suppression to get the cycle started as fast as possible. The religious aspect was built around that idea and it's why so many different groups have the same idea.  Those who want total power use the same methods all over the world.",393

1f7ikbf,ll9fbrz,SteakEconomy2024,"I remember being in a comparative religion class in college, and the teacher, a very tolerant pastor, invited two of his former students to talk about Islam, these two women were talking about how they were so happy with Islam, because it protects them, and they are in all ways equal to men. 

I happened to have been reading through Islam, Quran, and Hadith, and I just happened to have been reading the passage about how a women’s testimony was only worth half that as a mans. 

There was an awkward silence, they asked where I got that idea from, I grabbed the translation of the Quran out of my backpack, skimmed for about 20 seconds read it out loud, and handed them the book after they asked if they could see, Long silence, as they scanned the page for context they could use… finding none, there was a very awkward explanation of why women are untrustworthy, ‘because you know women, always  gossiping’. It was very awkward. 

Why is Afghanistan radical? Because most Muslims believe their religion is good, fair, and fundamentally in line with human rights, and choose to try to interpret texts in those way. In Afghanistan, you have a bunch of practically illiterates who read a verse and make up their interpretation based on what they just read. They don’t try to use higher level critiques, they don’t try to do what my visiting ‘experts’ did, and compartmentalize the parts that are negative towards women. They just read it and add it to their list of things they should do to torture women. They’re the equivalent of creationists, the book says it, they believe it.

1f7ikbf,ll84qhz,zulufdokulmusyuze,"During the golden of age of Islam, a few religious scholars took on interpreting every aspect of the Qoran (the holy book) and Hadith (the narratives from the prophet that are believed to be authentic). They wrote on every aspect of life, making strict decisions on what is allowed and what is not allowed. They were particularly obsessed with sexuality; they considered every single detail of one’s sex life. I believe they went into such detail because they were living in power and luxury, they had the opportunity to do “things” but they wanted to set some rules for the commons so that their legitimacy would not be questioned but also things would not go out of control. These rules were recognized as absolute because the Sultans who were protecting them were very powerful, it was the golden age after all.

The thing is: These interpretations stuck so long that they got engrained and no new interpretations were debated or allowed. Each society adapted these rules to their own ways of living (for example, homosexuality was legal and common in the Ottoman Empire throughout centuries, including in the court, because they were built on the geography where Ancient Greece thrived). But the rules that were invented by a bunch of 10th century highly-educated perverts remained on the books. The powerful remained powerful and kept external threats out, so there was no reason or room for change. Scientific skepticism and atheism did not make their way into Muslim societies, because the rulers successfully kept all developments out, including the printing press. So while there many syncretic beliefs and unorthodox sects questioning and challenging religious authorities, one thing remained not questionable at all: The faith itself.

Then came the 20th century. All of a sudden, muslim countries were invaded by outsiders, mostly Christians, against whom they were victorious for a a long time. This created a reactionary ideology: Islamism. They went back to the books, found things that they were not adhering to, and decided advocating that they were in this situation because they diverted from the path of Islam. More secular interpretations that aimed a western-like social life also emerged but these mostly remained popular among the educated elite and most people were still uneducated. As Islamism became more popular, they started making gains and taking over power. As they established their own institutions, they referred back to the 10th century interpretations and found sexual matters particularly useful in asserting their power. Wherever the struggle was most fierce, the more powerful and the more strict they became - exactly in the way cults work. Afghanistan is a striking example because they have been under occupation for decades (first Soviets, then civil war, then the United States). Islamists were actively supported by the United States during the Soviet invasion, so they got money and power, and wanted more.",13
1f7ikbf,ll9uv10,Al-Rediph,"Religion. Things happen usually on a spectrum. And you will have extremes. Islam as a whole has shifted over centuries to less tolerance compared to other religious movements. Of course, you will have very liberal Muslims. And moderate Muslims, and everything in between. But also worse than even the Taliban regime (like the Islamic State).

Why the Taliban ... probably because the constant war conditions and tribal and ethnic diverse society allowed them to get to power and enforce this. And because for many people in the region, religion gives them a sense of value that is hard to get otherwise. 

Politics in Afghanistan are more complicated than people think. Taliban don't have a direct rule as much as people think. Tribal leaders have a high level of power in many villages and regions, outside Kabul for example. So situation varies. Is more of a feudal state.

I was, of course very supportive, but sincerely - platonic through and through. They eventually split, and of course she had sad moments, which I supported her as best I could.

One night she said ""I really wanna kiss you right now.""

Next time I saw her in that head set (yup, that makes it even more funny) I really laughed cause I’d forgotten the dream since then. 

She asked me what was up and she’s the cool kinda friend I was able to be like “ah……so……I had this dream.” She thought it was hilarious and we had a joke ever since any time she’s in the headset.

I had a dream so vivid of my ex's best friend that I truly didn't know if it was real or a dream during it because I took a nap, in the dream, and 'woke up' still inside it. It was incredible, we spent time together playing games, going shopping, like an entire IRL day of stuff where she was the biggest sweetheart and helping distract me from my ex cheating on me. When it all came to a conclusion with us getting freaky deaky at night that's when my brain finally trolled me and kicked in right as I was about to climax and I woke up.

My ex's best friend is a total cunt and a self-centered POS. She came over to get some of my ex's stuff and was straight screaming at me that I wasn't a real man because I wouldn't forgive my ex. Started laughing obnoxiously when I started crying saying it was too late for tears and that even if I DID forgive her she wouldn't take my sorry ass back.

If ever I wanted to play a mobile game (and I didn't already know it wasn't my type of game), I might give it a try because I'm already familiar with it. And that's all the advertising team wants.

As for Google's position on it, you're still using YouTube without an adblocker, which is the win they're looking for because you're still sticking around, viewing adverts. They show advertisers statistics that show how many viewers watch ads and that helps them promote YouTube as a valuable platform to buy adspace.

One day in 1966, the stuntman Gene LeBell was called to the set of the television series “The Green Hornet” to deal with Bruce Lee, the future martial arts superstar, who played Kato, the crime-fighting Hornet’s sidekick. Mr. Lee, it seems, was hurting the other stuntmen.

The stunt coordinator asked Mr. LeBell — a former national judo champion and professional wrestler — to teach Mr. Lee a lesson, perhaps with a headlock.

Mr. LeBell would later recall in many interviews that he went further: He picked Mr. Lee up, slung him over his back and ran around the set as Mr. Lee shouted, “Put me down or I’ll kill you!” When Mr. LeBell relented, he was surprised that Mr. Lee didn’t attack him. Instead they came to appreciate their different skill sets, and Mr. LeBell became one of Mr. Lee’s favorite stuntmen.

They also trained together, with Mr. LeBell’s expertise as a grappler meeting Mr. Lee’s fist-flashing kung fu brilliance.

A gentle touch while having goosebumps feels like being skinned. And so much more. And it's *24/7.*

Pain is sooo subjective. My chronic pain is NOT worse than someone's endometriosis, that's not how a body's pain perception works. Your worst pain will always be that: the worst!

I still took the time to look up heart attack symptoms because I thought I was too young before I called 911. 

Ambulance came and took me to the “leading” heart hospital in my area. 

Because I have a history of mental illness; when the initial testing came back negative for a cardiac infarction the attending physician ordered a psych evaluation. 
No one believed me when I kept repeating, “ I know I’m crazy, but I’m not crazy about this. Something is wrong with my heart.”

I wasn’t a threat to myself or anyone else so they prescribed me some Xanax and recommended I schedule some therapy and sent me home. 

I ate that shit. Hoping for some relief. Had a friend babysit my kids and spent the night on my parents’ couch. I didn’t sleep. The elephant was still sitting on my chest. 

The next morning I begged my mom to take me back to the ER. She didn’t want to. Because my life at that time was particularly stressful she believed that I just needed to check myself into a psych ward. I sobbed to my dad again that I knew I was crazy but I wasn’t crazy about this. She ended up taking me to an immediate care clinic. 

That doctor diagnosed me with an inflamed chest wall, prescribed me anti-inflammatories, heating pads and hot showers. 

Two days later my roommate begged me to go back to the hospital because I was gray and could barely get off the couch. I was terrified of being labeled crazy again and getting placed on a 72 hour hold.

I dealt with pain in between periods from endometriosis. Last week I felt like I had those good ol’ cramps back. Happens about twice a year.  OBGYN who specializes in this condition said it can happen bc of where my growth always was. Right along the nerves. All of my doctors considered it chronic pain. It’s not considered a disability bc they figure we can plan around it. And that’s bc guys don’t have to deal with this and they are the ones who make these sorts of decisions. Until females are the ones making the decisions, some people will never take it seriously. Any pain, even if common, is not normal. It is a sign something is wrong. It may not be serious. It may just be muscle cramping based on the changes our body undergoes through our cycle. 

I have lupus, bipolar, and a list of other issues that could fill a medical journal. There are times I can not walk. I still went all of the way to a hearing. I had a woman judge who said I’m going to have you take me through a good day, a bad day and a normal day after asking about how many of each I had a month. We started with bad day. I have at least 15 a month. She stopped me two sentences in, went on a tangent about how it wasn’t approved the first time. My lawyer told me most of their clients are female bc the system takes us less seriously. And I’ve noticed when trying to get diagnosed, that seems to be the answer.

1f7k1x9,ll980v2,Usual-Percentage-309,"I believe I understand your point, but you are comparing apples to oranges a bit. 


For one, with my chronic headache and chronic migraine diagnoses, the number of days per month is taken into account. Chronic is 15 days or more a month and episodic is 3 to 15 days per month. 


Also, sometimes the same terminology is used for a primary disorder and a symptom. For example, I also have chronic insomnia which could either be a symptom of my chronic headaches and migraine or a separate disorder. I believe pain would be considered a symptom of a reproductive disorder like PCOS or endometriosis. In the case, you wouldn't have chronic pain as a disorder. Pain as a symptom still needs to be taken seriously and addressed. 


Another commenter already noted this, but your take on chronic migraine was very dismissive. People with chronic migraine do literally have migraine all the time. Some do not have migraine attacks every day, but our brains have migraine disorder all the time; our brains experience the world through the differences in our brains, and many, like me, have symptoms ever day.


I get the impression that you are frustrated that you don't get the recognition you deserve for the pain associated with your condition and perhaps feel dismissed.

Also, and MUCH more importantly, did they happen to provide you with a written, signed document stating that they actually agree to pay those charges?

Question #1 will inform whether or not you actually have anything to ""send"" to collections. Contrary to popular belief collections agencies aren't mafia enforcers that you can just tell ""go beat up Joey from the place with the thing, he's got a funny hat, you'll know him."" They need a way to definitively track someone down because targeting the wrong individual can rain hell upon their business. Believe it or not no one likes debt collection agencies so they are pretty harshly regulated.

Question #2 will inform how hard the person who gets a collections letter will laugh, because the first thing google tells you when searching ""how to beat collections"" is to ask them to prove you legally owe the debt, and if they fail to verify your ownership of the debt, they are not allowed to impact your credit file and you're under no obligation to engage with them. If there is no written documentation that you agreed to pay for anything, whether or not the service is performed means fuck-all. They didn't agree to pay you, you're entitled to nothing. If you've ever wondered why restaurants ask you to sign a credit card slip... now you know. Those poor parents probably signed one of those famous hospital forms saying ""i agree to pay blah blah blah not covered by insurance.""

So in summary: good question but no, that's not how any percentage of that shit works.

You also failed to factor in how much collections agencies actually charge lenders to collect from debtors. Sometimes they take a cut as big as 50% what's recovered. If they're simply buying the debt, it's closer to 4% on average. Meaning that you will have to do this with millions of dollars worth of phony debt AND successfully launder all that money to pay your defense attorneys when you inevitably get hit with felony fraud charges.

You need to have a contract with someone.  Where you both agree to the parameters of a service-what constitutes the service and the price. And then the service would have to be performed satisfactory according to the contract (and common sense).

1f7sd7o,llaqqsq,Ok-Introduction-244,"Unpopular opinion but there is a lot of research that demonstrates people (men and women) report being attracted to different things than what they are actually attracted to. It's a complex thing. 

You could certainly test this yourself by digitally manipulating the same eyes onto different bodies and having the men rate them - or by having them rate women with their natural eyes and then having them rate the eyes alone.

Lots of times the more accurate statement becomes: 

&gt; Men are commonly attracted to the eyes of conventionally attractive women.

Or 

&gt; Men are commonly attracted to conventionally attractive women who wear colored contacts, eyelash extensions and eye makeup.

If you Google image search for 'Woman with attractive eyes', aside from all of the top results looking very fake (filters and/or colored contacts); they are all women with nearly perfectly symmetrical faces. They are all models.

Finally, lots of studies show that men and women are incapable of evaluating individual aspects of a person objectively or accurately, without being impacted by their other features too. A man who says they find intelligent women attractive will rate the intelligence level of a conventionally attractive woman higher than that of an uglier woman. They test it by giving groups of men the same dating profiles of fictional women, changing only the photo. The hot women get rated more intelligent, even though everything else is the same. 

This halo effect makes it incredibly difficult for us to really know what we find attractive. 

It also helps partially explain why many people are attracted to people that don't match what they verbally say they look for.

Saying this is like hearing a single person say ""Getting a girlfriend/boyfriend will make me happy and not feel lonely. Anyone who's says different is lying because they already have a gf/bf and are happy already"".... Oh, it could just be that people in relationships actually understand the nature of relationships and understand that happiness isn't a package deal that comes with them

Yes, you'll probably get a slight endorphin spike at the beginning but you'll eventually even back out to your normal emotional state. So, if all you did was bitch and moan and complained about what you didn't have before you have money, you'll eventually do the same thing once you get used to having money. 

Imagine you get to a point where you can buy anything you want, whenever you want. Money literally becomes like air to you. You don't even think about it. Eventually, other problems will have a chance to arrive. If you haven't learned contentment and problem solving skills before that, you'll let those problems consume you and affect your mood like you did your money problems. Besides that, how many trips can you go on or how many exotic dinners can you buy or how many cars can you drive before it just becomes as mundane as the endless movie selection on Netflix?

Put it to you another way. Imagine there's someone who's thirsting for water. Literally maybe can only drink one glass a day. Then you have someone who has basically unlimited access to water. The thirsting person may think in their mind ""Man, they have more than enough water to not only survive, but just to waste on cooking and other frivolous things. They must be so happy knowing that they have unlimited access to water. If only I had water like that, I'd be the happiest man in the world!""

So, eventually, that becomes their reality. They finally managed to have unlimited access to water. At first, they are filled with endorphins. All they can think about is how much water they have. Eventually tho, as time goes on, the weeks, the months, the years, they don't even consciously think about it. It's just another thing. Hell, some days, they barely drink water. Not only that, now since water isn't their main concern anymore, they start to realize that there's other problems in life to worry about and begin to become less happy because of that.

Once you used to that level, you desire for more. So ultimately money can trap you in the pain/suffering-pleasure cycle like a hamster on the wheel. And the more you have, more scared you're to let go. 
And so people say money doesn't buy happiness.

People say that this is the fate of 70% of lottery winners. The reality is that you will replace one problem in life with another. You may be comfortable for a few years - that's it.  

House or food or insurance is really not a problem if you live in a normal country and have a normal job.  Will you buy a bigger house? Go ahead. Bigger house equals more expenses, and that means you will be broke and sad faster.

Helping others is also a problem because EVERYONE with some kind of money problem will approach you, and most of them won't be good people. And there are criminals you will have to worry about. They might try to kidnap you and drain your account. And it will be especially easy if you are dumb enough to ""buy whatever you want and help whoever you want"" because large withdrawals won't alert the bank.

&gt;Happiness isn't a physical thing so you can't buy it, but it can buy a ton of practical and fun things that make you happy

Then, you will realize that you will be happy you have a new gadget or something for a short time, and you will go back to being your miserable self. Because none of the things you can buy can make you happy. And every thing you buy will add to your problems.",1

Unfortunately it seems like the vast majority of people who gain that kind of wealth don’t feel that way.

1f7e3kl,ll7el6a,Valirys-Reinhald,"The public transit thing is more about population density and urban layout than it is scale.

In Europe, the population density is about 7× higher than in the US and is more or less evenly distributed, whereas the US has clearly defined areas of high population interspersed with vast tracts of rural land. The cost of running public transit across the vast areas increases with each added square mile of coverage, but the population to support it just isn't there. 

Furthermore, the US was largely settled after the Industrial Revolution, and it shows in its layout. Where European cities grew from walkable centers out and were fully developed before cars and trains, most US cities developed after or during these inventions. This removed the necessity of having worker housing within walking distance from industry, and services within distance of housing. This creates distinct districts in American cities where the city center, typically semi-walkable, exclusively hosts industry and commerce while the population resides outside or on the edges of that center, commuting in for the ease of having a central hub. However, public transit needs to have universal coverage to be relied upon. You need to be able to reliably travel from any place in the city to anywhere else, and this isn't feasible when the city is so spread out and the services are located in their own isolated areas instead of being evenly distributed. You don't have the option of taking the local route to everything you need because the cities weren't built around the limitations of walking distances.

Public transit is also slower than private transit on average, due to having to wait for the bus/train and then to walk from the stops to your final destination. There are two ways to fix this. Firstly, by having more frequent busses/trains to reduce wait times. Secondly, by increasing the number of stops per area. Both cost more money, both to install and to maintain, and increase the population density needed to support them.

There's also the issue of critical mass. If the public transit isn't at a certain level of convenience/quality, then it isn't worth using most of the time. And if people aren't using it, then it won't have the funds to support upgrades to increase its convenience/quality.

All this combines to make public transit truly un-viable in all but a handful of high-population density cities that were settled before full industrialization, Ie. East Coast colonial cities that have seen steady growth since their founding. There are only a handful of cities that meet these requirements, such as New York, Philadelphia, Washington DC, and a handful of others.",25

I’m black and lived in buns most my life cause it’s easiest, my sis did my braids and I’d never learned - so to assume they know nothing maybe presumptive also.

The kid is two, she’s too young to care about her appearance, and it doesn’t sound like the questionable haircare is hurting her? I get that hair is a sensitive topic in Black culture, but if this kid is living in a white bubble (which is its own issue), she’s unlikely to run into any negative experiences related to her hair at this young age. It’s a bit “tree falls in the woods”… if no one in her community recognizes the matted bun as a “bad” hairstyle, is it actually bad? And even if people realuze her hair looks funky, they might not think it matters. Lots of white kids have atrocious haircuts in their baby pictures. I knew a redhead who looked like a balding old man until she was four…

Idk, this feels like a topic to worry about later, once the kid is old enough to care about looking good…",1

When I am working on something, my brain and I are in sync and I don't have much of an internal monologue going on.

It's like being a conductor for a silent horde of monkeys, a hundred track mind made manifest within itself.

Despite this, my internal monologue's voice is a whisper upon my breath, for all characters. When I daydream, I can easily visualize colors, shapes, and three-dimensional spaces. I don't dream much, but when I do, none of those characters have a voice, either. It's as though I'm reading from a script and watching a TV show on mute.

I can task my monkeys with a problem I can't figure out.

1f7tlqh,ll9snz8,Concrete_Grapes,"For reference, the older child (12) cannot hear his unless he forces it--'there's nothing there' he will insist, and mean it. He's navigating in silent mode. It's weird to me, because he's *also* gifted, so, uh, that's usually tied to a narrator in there. He thinks in pictures, mostly, i think. When he reads, he doesnt hear a voice then either, he *takes pictures* of the words, ties *feelings* to it, and stores it whole. When he goes to recall it, it comes back by pressing on the feelings, and the words pop back in and he *then* hears them. It's wild. 

Anywho, i have 4 solid, near full time narration layers. All the same 'me' same person, same sounding narrator--but it's layers. 1 is phsyical sensations and blabbering. head to toe--just a running stream of narrating info about it. Second is observation and feeling--records what the fucks going on, what i feel, or asks what i *should think i feel*, to the third layer, that tries to mash all of those together. This layer is the struggle bus layer, and the first 'this is me' layer. It can be the one i 'listen' to most--trying to exist. 4th is the 'i think' layer, the first layer where i exist. When i read, when i think, this is the reporter and narrator and thinker. It's trying to juggle all the rest, and when this one's active, frequently, layer 1 and 2 go offline, but layer 3 gets more demanding--like, i'm TRYING to focus right now on writing this, and the thoughts about my foot and what i need to do about it are just getting demanding enough to be annoying. The 'final', and not always present layer, is .... 5th.. a 'living in third person' layer. This happens REALLY frequently while doing things like walking outside, mowing lawns, shopping, etc. All the other layers are present, but this one sort of--top them all off, and observes me as a struggling primate unit doing a juggling act. 

And the final one is super rare, and blinks in and out (and is NEVER present on adhd meds), and it's ... above that one, and the others become babble, and everything feels absurd. When this one hits, i often laugh at how absurd existing at all even is, and how badly that unit is struggling to juggle this shit. It exists for a second or two, and winks out, leaving me with this profoundly detached existing feeling, and ... a humerous outlook on it all. 

It's annoying as fuck. 

As far as mental images go, i can create mental movies, like, real, fiction, etc. I can do it for memories too--all the way down to about 6 months old. I can perfectly imagine, and *walk* in my kindergarten class, 35 years removed. It's that real. Sound, temperature, taste, feeling--all of it's there. Eyes closed, it gets so real it gets disorienting. Unreality when i open my eyes. So, i can do it eyes open, almost like a second screen (feels like back of my head, but, idk, i just know i can do it).",5

Funny enough, the more you practice the parallel type of thinking, the further your own mental capabilities develop so I don't think there is an exclusivity between lines of thought, just more apparent percentages of adaptable thought.

When I need to go somewhere or do things or not do things or say or not say things there's always a voice directing and telling me what to do or not to do. What to think or not to think. Most of the time when I'm being negative, another voice or inner voice will ""lecture"" me and sort out the situation for me.

This all happens as I'm reading and the images change as soon as I get to a different word.

At their worst, chiropractors yank on your neck so hard it can literally paralyze you.

Thankfully I had written proof, in the receptionist/wife's handwriting, and never went back or had to pay.

As treatments, even those based in alternative medicine (Chinese Traditional, Chiropractic, Osteopathic, etc) develop evidence, we integrate them into the appropriate realm of our medical care (medicine, surgery, therapy disciplines). Disciplines like chiropractic have little incentive to pursue evidence for their treatments, as largely they won't find them (though I'm sure they would occasionally find something to be beneficial), and their entire shtick is to put on a show for the patient to create the mother of all placebo effects and maybe create temporary relief that doesn't have long-term benefit. 

  
So, to answer the question, YES, they are quackery, because they have no desire to determine efficacy of their own treatments, along with naturopathic medicine, TCM, portions of osteopathic medicine, etc. TCM is the least offensive of these because it developed long before the mechanisms existed to determine effectiveness on large scales, but the others were basically quacks from the get-go.",3

Even on injuries with terrible bruising and swelling he’d hook me up to the stim machine, making wherever the pads were attached spasm uncontrollably in pulses. To what end? To bill insurance for it apparently, it certainly didn’t do shit for healing anything. 

Absolute quackery. Granted, there is something to be said about spinal alignment and myofascial release’s benefits to injury prevention, recovery, and athletic function.

Surgeons have told me there is nothing they can do until spine replacements becomes possible, and the only things non chiropractic doctors would do for pain was prescribe meds that didn’t help with anything.

1f6yn9z,ll3sek4,Indemnity4,"Historically, it developed due to fuel use and who is doing the work.

China in particular had very little fuel for cooking.  Chefs did all the preparation work in the kitchen, chopping food into small portions that would cook fast (less fuel).  To eat only requires a spoon or some sort of device to shovel/push the food into your face.  The bowl or plate is lifted up to the mouth, then you scrape it in.

Europe had lots of forests, so lots of cheap fuel.  The cheapest way to prepare food was have a big fire burning all day, put big hunks of food near it for a long time, then serve those big hunks.  Doesn't require as much interaction from the chefs, so they can go off and make more sauces, condiments, or multiple courses.  Once you have big hunks of meat or bread served, the people eating need to cut off small pieces for themselves.  This usually means waiters or butlers or servers.  Most people ate by positioning a plate near the big hunk, using their knife to slice of pieces, scrape onto their own plates then eating using a piece of bread or the knife or a spoon/paddle thing to shove it in their mouth hole.  

This is messy eating.  Eventually, the French invented table manners and the plate became metaphorically glued to the table.  The ""invention"" of the fork in about 1700's when the French invented a style of dining called *haute cuisine* or *service a la francais* (modern day buffet) where all the food is on the table at once.  The person eating stabs it with the fork to hold in place, the knife slices pieces off for eating.  About only 200 years ago, this morphed into the *service a la russe* (e.g. Russian dining), which is what is modern western dinner morphed into about 100 years ago.  Sequential plates or courses (entree, main, dessert), people (or a waiter) serve themselves big hunks and the diners use knife and fork to portion it even smaller.  You now have the movie problem of 8 different knives on the table, which one for which course?  Oh no, social faux pas.

1f6yn9z,ll47u1n,cawfytawk,"My take on Asian cuisines, as a Chinese person, is that 1) We eat communal style so the dishes are already bite sized when served. Chopsticks have been in use for nearly 4000 years. The Chinese word translates to ""quick ones"". 2) Prepping meat into smaller pieces cooks more evenly and picks up more flavor throughout. 3) Stabbing at your food with a fork or knife is frowned upon. Serving spoons might be provided but never knives or forks. 

With Caucasian style food, it tends to be served in individual portions of whole pieces of meat that's baked or fried. Some things like roasts and whole chickens  will be cut just before serving but you risk the internal juices running out leaving the meat dry.",25

The reason being that traditional food mostly consists of stews eaten with rice or bulgur so a spoon is a perfectly reasonable vehicle to use. Other non-saucy food is often eaten with bread where the piece of bread is shaped into a “scoop” to allow you to eat without your fingers touching the food directly. Meat and chicken are often served whole but fall-off-the-bone so you can just take as much as you want of it with your hand or a piece of bread or a utensil without the need for a knife. The concept of “portioning” isn’t really a thing as it’s seen as lack of generosity - you just serve ALL the food and everyone takes as much as they want.

Chopsticks can be used to shear soft foods, but if you are using chopsticks to shear your Asian food a lot, something is amiss with the food.

What about sexual harrassment feels so distant to you that you don't feel like you can acknowledge predatory behaviour when it hits you?

There is a culture around sending unsolicited dick pics and it is complex and vile.

A vast majority of men [send them in the hopes of getting nudes back](https://www.psypost.org/new-psychology-research-reveals-mens-motives-for-sending-unsolicited-dick-pics/).

All of these men have, and for far over a decade now, completely ignored the *huge* amount of women constantly talking about how much they do not want that. 

Countries have since started to enforce laws to charge unsolicited dick pic-senders with a *crime*. 

You remember seeing movies when you were young that had the creepy guy in a trench coat randomly flashing strangers? It's that exact behaviour.


And to really understand why this is so horrible, you need to understand what data we have on this exact form of exhibitionism.

Said data has shown that it's about power. ""I force you to see."" is the underlying dynamic they establish when they do this.

The ones who ask are thirstbags - they still don't care about you or the conversation, they just want to get their load off.

And the uninvited senders? They want to know that you had to look.


With all that in mind, please do not humour such men. There is decent people out there who respect consent and who care for what **you** want just as much as their own wishes.

These are the people you want in your life. Make sure to avoid the others - they do not want good things for you.",5

You could just block them and move one. Or try and mess with them like some suggestions in here (calling it a child's penis, sending a dick pic back etc.).

Everyone will say you should just do any job no matter how shit the job or low pay, otherwise you’re a leach. Ok, well if you work in the grocery store for minimum wage you’re being leached off by people with millions in the bank. 

Work doesn’t pay for the majority of people in these types of jobs, I totally understand why you would ask the question whether it’s worth it at all. 

Personally I think you should try to learn something you can do to make money or earn a more fair wage rather than just settling for anything. You could easily find yourself in a shitty job and ten years pass by because you’re too tired to do anything after work to improve your life. 

You’ve got one go at this, give two fucks to what people think, find what works for you. If you can get by and be happy, more power to you. The meaning of life is not to slave away day in day out to make other people rich despite what the sheep will tell you. 

For the down voters: All the good intentions and honest work ethic in the world can’t account for a broken society. Give people the ability to own their home in 15/20 years and support a family off one person working a low level job (yes it can be and had been done) or this will always be a question.

1f7hp62,ll81274,Dante451,"I think the series is beloved as a unique concept. Like, magic space samurais is a pretty cool idea, and Star Wars as a whole is basically a samurai/western film in space. The OT nails this aesthetic and doesn’t have any egregious plot holes. Nobody cares about how or why light speed travel works because it doesn’t matter. It’s about the characters and how they grow and what choices they make. 

The hate comes from the other movies poorly blending into the prior worldbuilding. It’s fine to have a trade war as a backdrop to a samurai film (see the samurai movie Yojimbo). It’s not so fine to make the magic space samurais a rather inconsequential part of the movie. It felt like the prequel movies were just one extended advertising opportunity for new merchandise. Add on weird plot holes or poorly explained plot plus Annakins terrible writing/acting and it’s a let down. The single most important character in the prequel comes off as a whiny teenager even though he’s supposed to be a general. 

Same problem for the sequel trilogy. It’s like they had no original ideas so they just remade a new hope but bigger. Movies 8 and 9 also violate the rule on not overly explaining how or why the tech works. Why are we watching some cat and mouse tech chase thing? The central plot point should never be about some new complex technology that can’t be distilled into something simple like “moon sized laser cannon.” The magic space samurai should win the fight, not the power of friendship. 

So imo the prequel and sequel are weaker films because they just culminate too many mistakes. There’s not a singular issue to be fixed that would solve everything, but rather little issues that just break down the suspension of disbelief that a good sci fi story needs to succeed.",6

The first 3 movies where both groundbreaking for their time and quite good. The prequels being bad is a topic that has been analyzed at length, you and I and other people can like them that does not make them good movies. ( for example I like ""Sky captain and the world of tomorrow"" a lot but objectively it was not a good movie )

The Disney trilogy is objectively spectacularly bad and so clearly out of sync with the vibe of the rest of the universe that it's mind-blowing that they managed to mess it up so much.

But when you move to the cartoons or the other movies opinions are not so universally negative because many are good. Lots of people didn't really care for Solo but it wasn't a disaster, Rogue one is well liked as is Andor. Bobba fet got a lot of crap because it deserved it, being on par with a bad season of Xena warrior princess in terms of quality. But the mandalorian is / was popular.

And that is not even touching on the stories / books of the expanded universe that are genuinely very good.

Between being bounced between directors, with no clear endgame in sight, it really fumbles building up a world, having all the characters have a satisfying arc, the music and maybe the special effects are the saving grace, if anything.

  
The prequel trilogy, was George Lucas taking the success of the first three movies (for which he had a lot of help for), and doing it on his own. Which meant that he had final say, he had no one to reign in his ideas or redraft/rewrite anything. There is a good story there, but sometimes the plotting and the acting can't hold it up, because Lucas instructs actors to perform a certain way, so there isn't a lot of wiggle room like the actors MIGHT have had in the Original Trilogy.

  
There is also the over reliance on CG, so not only are the actors confined to a blue screen set to act on, but then they also can't really interact with their surroundings. So they are acting towards each other, and maybe sometimes people dressed in green suits with tennis balls on their heads for focal points. But the atmosphere is also not there.",1
1f7hp62,ll83ppd,Chronoblivion,"I wouldn't go as far as ""hate"" for any of them (though I disliked 8 enough that I still haven't gotten around to watching 9), but I think there are two major problem for fans: one is the fact that each trilogy has a significant shift in tone. 4-6 were a fantasy adventure in space. 1-3 were much more political. I can't speak to 9 since I haven't seen it, but 7 was more about creating mystery around the protagonists, and 8 was about trying to retcon it by taking a series that centered on larger-than-life characters and making it about nobodies. 

None of this would necessarily be a bad thing if it were executed well, but the second major problem was that people thought the quality of writing dropped significantly after the first three (arguably the first two). George Lucas's wife at the time was apparently one of Hollywood's best editors and it's been argued by some that she reined in a lot of his jank and deserves most of the credit for the success of original trilogy. By the time he got around to the prequels that success was working against him as he was surrounded by yes-men and sycophants who were afraid to tell him some of his ideas were stinkers. And the sequel trilogy was seen by many as a cash grab by a soulless mega-corporation; a common criticism of 7 was that it was derivative and unoriginal, that they were just playing it safe to make an easy buck.",1

And is having a second Death Star (which even by current canon took a stupid amount of logistics and resources to build) really any cheezier than ""Somehow Palpatine returned?"" In my opinion, no.

1f7hp62,ll8ef69,ThePurpleSoul70,"The Original Trilogy was like no-one had ever seen. It was revolutionary. It holds up pretty well but overall, it has a charm that the other two trilogies have not managed to recapture. It's by no means perfect, but it's a product of its time and has a sincerity to it that the other two don't (this is mostly due to the fact that the films aren't actually directed by George Lucas and a number of other filmmakers had heavy hands in making them as good as they could.)

The Prequel Trilogy had a good story but had terrible scripts. The VFX were good, but overall people were dissuaded by the virtually unlistenable dialogue because the screenplay basically was not edited. George Lucas was pretty much the only guy who looked at the script before they started shooting and had full control over the final cut, resulting in films that were not easy to watch. The man is a good storyteller but cannot write dialogue.

The Sequel Trilogy was entirely a cash-grab. It was basically the start of the legacy sequel craze in Hollywood that's continued to the present day. There was virtually no passion involved with the creation of the films, and the story for the films wasn't planned out after the first one, so it felt disjointed and clumsy. The scripts also weren't great for those, as they decided to go for typical action blockbuster type comedy. They were entirely a product of focus groups, executives and investors.

So far, the only piece of Star Wars media that has managed to recapture the feeling of the Original Trilogy is Andor, a TV show that released two years ago (with a second season releasing next year.) It isn't nearly as light-hearted as the Originals, but it feels like a natural evolution of the atmosphere while infusing a little more serious commentary and subject matter. Its accompanying movie, Rogue One, is also really good, but is pretty polarising.",1

Secondly, Star Wars is for kids. Ewoks and Wookies and Droids and all that are delightful for children. Many of us were kids when we saw the original and it seemed so cool. The diet of more serious SW content caused us to be less interested in the kid content that the movies stuck with.

Then the movies are just riddled with plot holes and refrigerator logic on top of their basic plots.

I think that the culture war stuff only appeared because the movies were disappointing anyway, so they were easy targets for any axe anyone had to grind.

I think Solo was excellent. I think Rogue One was good.


But I will say this: Star Wars makes you feel a certain way when you're a kid. It's magic. It makes you feel like the universe is bigger than you imagined and makes you want to be a hero and go on adventures. The ones you saw as a kid will make you remember that feeling again and again. But as an adult, that feeling just isn't going to come again (EEAAO is the closest I've gotten). If you go into a new Star Wars movie expecting that feeling will be replicated, you may indeed be filled with hatred when it doesn't. Meanwhile, the seven year old sitting in the next row walked out of The Last Jedi imagining that broom flying into his hand and went on to watch it on Disney+ every day for three months and is forcing some kid to pretend to be DJ again.

1f7jqan,ll80vyi,Alycery,"I’m younger than you, but I already know no one will  ever truly love and accept me. On top of that, I’m a female. Which I feel comes with its own set of challenges because in my western society women are seen as creatures that are sought after. Basically, if we aren’t with a mate… something is clearly wrong with us. Are we crazy? Too ugly? Too fat? Too high of standards? Do we have too many babies with just as many baby daddies? Stereotypical bullshit like that. 

I have come to the conclusion that if I give another guy attention, he will turn out to be like all the rest; a user and/or abuser. That’s all I’ve ever had in relationships. And I know that’s all I’ll ever have. So, it’s either having relationships like that, which aren’t relationships. Or being alone. There is no third option for me, where I actually find a guy that will treat me well and isn’t completely insane. There is no third option where I find a guy that loves and accepts me. 

It’s a hard truth to face. I don’t think a lot of people can face that truth with a straight face, lol. So, I think a lot of people keep ending up in the same type of bad relationships because at least they’re in a relationship and they’re hoping this time it will be different. But the truth of the matter is that not everyone finds love. I’m talking about healthy, real love. Not, “I love you for a time, but now I wish death upon you” type of love. That’s not love to me. Or at least not the one I want. A lot of people do find real love. They actually find it multiple times. But, that’s not the reality for a lot of other people. Or maybe some people have found love, but lost it.  That’s a reality for a lot of elderly people or people who lost their love due to death. 

Regardless of that, just because you don’t find love doesn’t mean something is wrong with you or your life. It doesn’t mean that you don’t have people who love you. I’m sure you have a lot of people who love and care about you. I’m sure you have and have had a very impactful life. You’re not less than because you don’t have someone that loves you. Your life is not any less fulfilling because someone doesn’t love you.  And if anyone tells you otherwise, they can suck an egg and choke on it. They’re dumb and don’t understand the nuances of living. Not everyone’s life is going to be stereotypically perfect. I’m not saying those lives don’t exist. I’m not of the belief that no one is perfect or has a perfect life. I think that’s bullshit. There are perfect people out there with perfect lives. That’s just truth. I’m just saying not everyone is given the same chances in life. 

Of course, you can go out right now and probably find someone. But, do you think that relationship will lead to love? Only you can answer that. Some people get lucky and it does. Others just repeat the same kind of bad relationship that they have always been in. I know my answer. If I went out right now, sure… I can find someone. But, I know for a fact they will end up being a user and/or abuser. So, I rather be alone than have that bit of fleeting attention. But, your answer might be different.  

I’m not saying that your desire will ever stop. Mine hasn’t. I still want love. I want it very badly. I still have my days where I feel either utterly alone or lonely, which are two very different things. But, I just know better now. I have or am trying to face the truth. 

People say I’m pessimistic in my beliefs, kind of nihilistic. So, take my advice with whatever amount of grain of salt that you want. I’m not trying to say that you will never find love. That’s not all what I’m trying to say. I actually hope you do find love.

Dating as a Dad is tough let alone with a busy schedule. But not impossible. 

Late 40s and entering 50 is a hard time to find serious relationships. But not impossible. 

Turning 50 is just an age. Things don’t end once you cross that line. They didn’t end when you turned 20, 30, or 40 did they? 50 isn’t any different.

Dating apps take advantage of loneliness in many ways. Especially with what sounds like a stable sense of self and life, I’d encourage you to put less pressure on yourself to date and more pressure on yourself to just be you. Go out and do things you enjoy. Or things you and your kiddo enjoy. Go to places you like to go, do things you like to do. Push yourself and try new things that may be exciting or different and out of your comfort zone. The more time you spend having fun and being yourself, the more you start to find and meet similar people who also may enjoy those same things. And many won’t be but some of those people might be single. And some of those single people might be your type. And some of those that are your type might be interested. And so on so forth.

As an additional tip, take advantage of your kiddo. No not in any sort of terrible way. I mean genuinely take advantage of having a kid. Spend quality time with your kiddo. Be proud and celebrate them and yourself. Have stupid amounts of fun. Love that little sucker as consistently and often as you can. Not only will they love you back (which will help a little with that loneliness I can tell you) but if you do proudly and honestly, others will surely notice. And as someone who works in a hospital with many a very attractive single professionals, I hear a lot of women saying there isn’t much more attractive than an emotionally mature and available man who is a good father.

I'm severely introverted and full of anxiety (both parents enjoyed yelling at me, and I was emotionally bullied a lot in middle school and high school). I didn't lose my virginity until earlier this year, and while I will admit that I'm obviously not experienced, my ex didn't help accommodate me at all.

I'm in decent shape, well groomed, in touch with my emotions, well mannered (I was raised by a single mother with a younger sister, so I was raised to be a proper gentleman with more class than your 'average' male) to the point that most people's first thought to meeting me is that I am Gay or Bi, and have been told for years now that I'll 'make some lucky woman very happy one day'.

Just recently, I found out that my now ex lied to me about me being the father to the child she is carrying. She waited until I was a few weeks into my training rotation (Active Duty Army, 13J, I hit my 3 years this December) overseas before dropping hints bit by bit that I'm not the father (the biggest one being that the delivery date was pushed from November to October, and I can tell you for a fact that I'm not the father) to her admitting that she's been cheating on me with the same man who she claims raped her daughter because she thought our relationship wasn't going anywhere because we weren't having sex (her words, not mine. I told her from day one that I would always be willing to accommodate her for anything) and she told me that she knew she 'loved me' when I told her that I wanted her to be my first.

This is after a year of us staying together, me meeting her family, she meeting my family, and me being prepared to be a father to both her children (her daughter called me 'Daddy', and it hurts that I have to let her down), and she threw it all away for a fling with another man.

Then the guy ghosts the girl.

Women in turn complain that all men are awful, all while thinking that they’re prettier than they actually are because they were able to pull a guy out of their league.

So they try again. The cycle repeats.

1f7yu66,llapwyu,Astramancer_,"Bail is a way of making sure someone accused of a crime has 'skin in the game' (so to speak) to actually show up for their day in court.  If they are deemed too much of a flight risk or too much of a potential danger their bail might be denied outright or placed prohibitively high.  The judge has guidelines but a fairly large discretion for the amount that the bail will be.  Generally the more serious the crime and the wealthier the accused the higher the bail will be.  A $5,000 bail is not an incentive for a billionaire to show up in court for an assault charge, but a $50,000,000 bail is.

If you show up to court you get your bail money back, if you don't you don't (though it may go towards any monetary fines before you see any of it).

There's also ""bail bondsman"" that you can pay a small percent, I believe it's typically 10%, and they cover the rest, but that 10% is not just the down payment but also the fee.  If you show up in court you don't get that 10% back, the bondsman does (in addition to the rest that they put down).  You'll probably also have to guarantee the rest of the bail with things like the title to your car, which they WILL take you skip court.

I believe the original idea was that the bail money would towards paying a bounty hunter to bring you in by force if you don't show up on your own.  Bail bondsmen still employ bounty hunters to this day (who have a shockingly large legal leeway in the execution of the hunt... but a lot less than they sometimes think).

1f7ac4x,ll9qhk9,_indistinctchatter,"Reading the whole thread, there are a few BIG misconceptions here.

1. The counties in NV have **legalized** prostitution in brothels, not decriminalized prostitution.

2. **Decriminalized** prostitution is what sex workers want globally, because it's the model that offers the most safety and bodily autonomy. It means no consenting adults are arrested for sex where money is exchanged in private, full stop. It gets the police and the government away from people's bodies and preserves sexual freedom even if we may disagree with what such people are doing. It keeps women who are trying to survive out of jail, and allows sex workers to report violence and trafficking to the police without risking arrest.

3. **Legalization** is exploitation - brothels, whether in Europe, Asia, or NV, not only take a big cut of prostitute's income, but they also enforce strict curfews (the women cannot leave the brothel except with permission!), forced medical exams (imagine going through regular non-voluntary gyno exams), and sex workers must register/be licensed with the state (making it close to impossible for them to ever exit the industry, get child custody, get housing, etc - because sex work is still stigmatized and former prostitutes are still legally discriminated against). Legalization means surveillance of private sexual behavior, and when regulation happens, it's women's bodies being regulated. And those who want to work independently outside of the brothels (aka without having to hand over their earnings to the pimp/madam who owns the brothel) are still arrested, so it doesn't make anything better for anyone, besides making a few brothel owners rich! 

Decriminalize, don't legalize",2
1f7ac4x,ll68cn4,aardw0lf11,"No, simply because I honestly don't believe the government has the capacity or ability to regulate it sufficiently.",5
1f7ac4x,ll6psqj,Iwantapetmonkey,"It's tempting to think prostitution should just be completely legalized, something that I certainly agree with in principal since it seems like just a consensual arrangement on its face as long as the workers are protected and free.


If you read up on it more, and how it works for countries that have legalized it fully, both buying and selling, countries like Germany and the Netherlands, the problems and challenges of legalizatiin become more apparent.


[It's difficult to disentangle human trafficking and proatitution, even when legal and regulated.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X12001453#:~:text=We%20find%20that%20countries%20with,control%20for%20in%20the%20analysis.)  When you legalize prostitution at a large scale, you also stimulate demand for it, and so more workers are required to meet demand. The free market will provide supply for that demand one way or another, so the question becomes whether there are enough truly willing workers or not to fill that demand, and answer to that is often no. This is part of why some countries take the stance that offering services should be legal, but seeking them should be criminal still, to protect the workers, but keep demand inhibited.


Even among those workers who aren't trafficked, you have to also wonder how many are *truly* doing it consensually. I've certainly read accounts from legal protitutes before who choose it willingly and like their jobs, but I think this may be a minority. Like other jobs people might fall back to if they are desperate for money, they may actually hate their job and just do it to survive, a situation that has moral implications when the work involves selling your body.


There are additional issues like the way prostitution stimulates other crime, and its relationship to organized crime that may further suggest caution when considering full legalization. I'd encourage people to read up a bit on how it has worked out for countries with widespread full legalization because it may not be quite the utopia of sexual freedom it may seem at first thought (and note that the Nevada legalization is at a very small scale where it is only legal in a limited fashion in a handful of counties).",4

Just my opinion though, as I'm not really against or for decriminalization of prostitution. They are plenty of either lonely, unattractive, or people who do don't have time to play the pickup game that would benefit from the decriminalization of prostitution, especially the lonely and unattractive people as it would definitely help with reducing possibly some mental issues.

Us Brits love the use of extra letters, like the letter ""U"" for example in colour and humour, or just 'awkward' spelling in general; whereas America has streamlined the language to spell words more like they are verbally said- so color and humor in this example. There are other examples too like anaemia/anemia, cancelled/canceled, metre/meter, tyre/tire etc.

We also use different words for items as well, such as trousers/pants, car bonnet/hood, car boot/trunk, biscuit/cookie, chips/fries, crisps/chips etc

Now you  aren’t doomed just because it’s in your genetics, just likely anything heredity, it could skip you. You also could use a healthy lifestyle to mitigate it. This is why knowing your family history for medical conditions is important to discuss with your doctor. With your family history of older age, this at least genetically, adds odds for longer lifespan (+).


2. Environment: exposure to toxins and other things bad for our health can decrease life expectancy compared to people living in better environments. You could eat healthy and exercise regularly but if you live with high pollution, you have a higher likelihood of negative health effects than if you lived somewhere with less pollution. Again, not a death sentence or guarantee of anything, it just adds more (-) to the “odds” game of life expectancy.

Life expectancy is an incalculable combination of almost an infinite number of factors. Healthy living should more often than not increase your odds of a longer lifespan regardless of factors but there’s no “perfect guarantee”.

If you mean, ""Do flies have homes"" in the more individual, specific sense, the answer is no. Flies are, with a couple of very specific exceptions not eusocial, meaning that they don't form communities or cooperate on wider scales (very simple way to put it, google ""Eusocial"" if you want a more detailed explanation). 

As an example, if you relocated a fly from one ecosystem, to a similar or identical ecosystem where that species of fly could survive, then it would continue mostly as if nothing had happened. However if you did the same with a Worker Bee, they would not be able to because they have been separated from their colony (which could be considered their 'home'), if it was a queen bee then it could potentially start a new nest, but even then survival rates are very low unless someone cares for the new colony until it's properly established.",2

1f7zqih,llazpyx,tomveiltomveil,"Hi there!  I'm in a slightly different situation; I'm a former Catholic who's now Jewish, and part of the reason why I converted is because [Judaism is completely compatible with agnosticism](https://www.chabad.org/library/article_cdo/aid/443985/jewish/Is-Gd-an-Agnostic.htm).  For example, the greatest Rabbi of the European era, Maimonides, argued that ""god"" is undefinable.

First, the Catholic part: from the point of view of the church, you have every right to be there.  Under the official doctrine, [the priest is supposed to welcome you in](https://www.npr.org/sections/parallels/2013/05/29/187009384/Pope-Francis-Even-Atheists-Can-Be-Redeemed), and then patiently wait for you to repent and return to Catholicism.  It kind of has to be that way, or else priests would have a panic attack every time they had to host a wedding mass or a Christmas mass, both of which notoriously bring in lots of people who are obviously not observant Catholics.

Now the atheist part: well, as you know, one of the hallmark things about atheists is that they don't have a hierarchy that can give you an authoritative answer to your question.  There are certainly people who I'd call ""loud atheists,"" who would reprimand you for acting in a way that would cause a casual observer to think that you'd returned to the Church.  But I don't think most atheists would take that approach.  There's a reason why [another word for Atheist is Freethinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freethinkers_Society) - to the extent that there's an atheist dogma at all, it's the dogma that every person has the right to approach the ineffable, mystical side of the universe however they want.",1

1f6w19v,ll3hxik,TheMeltingSnowman72,"I've run plenty of restaurants and eaten at many, too. I didn't have many walkers in my time, maybe once when we had definitely bitten off more then we could chew and had over promised - a mistake I never made again. 

However, I've walked out of many restaurants because of poor service, slow waiting times, and I'll usually make my reasons clear before I leave if I can. I don't mind waiting a long time as long as I'm informed and given a reasonable reason why - I completely understand shit happens and I'm cool with it, you just need to communicate honestly with me. 

Customer awareness is directly a management issue if the servers aren't keeping an eye out, 100%. Anyone who blames staff under them, they are 100% the problem. Staff need to be trained to not only keep an eye out but also understand basic body language, as not everyone speaks up when they are dissatisfied - especially in UK where people will complain to their table to the point of distraction but as soon as you ask them they'll say in unison ""Yes, it's lovely thanks!"". So I teach my staff that customers like to lie about a lot of things, including their feelings because like them, a lot of these people have some level of social anxiety so you need to read between AND behind the lines. Once you can read the body language you can understand exactly how each table is getting on from a distance and it's far easier to check that way - as well as doing the usual table checks, but not so often. For example you can have a party table and everyone is laughing and joking but just a quick scan with your eyes shows that one person looks frustrated and not joining in. A second glance at their plate shows you they haven't touched much while everyone else has eaten theirs, that's when you step in nicely. Maybe they are the birthday boy/girl and it's just stress - no biggy, tell them next time they're at the bar they can have a shot on the house to calm the stress. But maybe their steak was just a little bit overdone to their liking but they feel bad saying anying and don't want to ruin the birthday vibes - that's when you can fix it.

Spending a bit of time on the training makes a servers live far easier and profitable, and it makes your restaurant/cafe/bistro/burger joint far more appealing to customers. It's a win win.",102

We ordered drinks. They then came to took our food order. I said we wanted to wait until our third person arrived. They seemed annoyed and I said we would order another round of drinks to keep the table, which the waiter reluctantly accepted. 


Our friend's train was delayed a bit further, and they told us we had to order food or give up the table. I was annoyed as it meant we couldn't eat together, and there was still plenty left in the game, but accepted and we ordered food. Then, before the food arrived, they said they had more customers and forced us to move to a two person table.


Ten minutes later, our friend and the food arrived at the same time. So we had three people and a table for just two. I told them they had been really rude to us, couldn't meet our needs, and we no longer wanted the food. We then walked out to another bar.",7

You may have consequences where the owner/manager may forbid you from entering (/being served) the restaurant in the future. 

(What could be their motivation? Maybe your food was made and you walked out a minute before the waiter was going to bring it out, so the restaurant sees that as a loss and won't want you to be back. That borders the ""dine and dash"" with the only difference in perspecrive of the restaurant being how soon they bus your table.

The oldest game *I* know about that had all three of those colors for those exact gauges was [The Elder Scrolls: Arena](https://shared.akamai.steamstatic.com/store_item_assets/steam/apps/1812290/ss_3426c2296258230868893c56ea63bffc889014d8.600x338.jpg?t=1650992611) (1994)

But there were earlier games that had red for health and blue for mana, like [Ultima Underworld](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/yuNymTPko3Y/maxresdefault.jpg) (1992), and almost certainly earlier examples I don't know about.

1f7vxtr,lla6pua,ahtemsah,"Most likely reason is that some game way early in the 70s, 80s, 90s whatever, was the first to come up with the colour scheme and everybody after that just followed it up.

1f7vxtr,lla8chk,Gotham-City,"It's mainly convention and standardisation.

Early in gaming, everyone was doing different things as there was no 'standard'. Controls would be different for each game, UI elements different, you needed to 'learn' each game's controls and UI. Over time, games started copying successful games, at least on the UI/UX level, to make them more approachable.

It's now very standard to have things like, movement being WASD, jump being space, reload R, sprint holding/toggling on shift, and so on. Controllers have the same idea.

UI followed pretty much as well.

Red has almost always been health, even pre-video games in things like tabletops, or even real life. The 'Red' Cross, medics, etc all usually represented by red. It was an obvious choice.

Mana was a bit varied, but most game designers went for 'mystic' colouring, based off magic users in literature, which often were blue, white, or purple. Warcraft II was the first really successful game (as in mainstream) that heavily used a magic system, and they used blue. From there it was quickly adopted in the 90s and by the 00s nearly every mana or magic system was in blue.

Stamina is still a bit fuzzy, but yellow or green are the two common ones. Morrowind famously used green for fatigue, which kind of started it. But some games opted for a green health bar so they tend to use yellow stamina.",5

1f7vxtr,lla5slf,[deleted],[deleted],1
1f7vxtr,llajsui,Fidodo,"In addition to what other people said I think there's more correlations to nature that give the colors an emotional connection to these concepts. 


Red is of course obviously connected to blood, but it's also the color of fire, and the sun at sunset, and various things in nature that tell you to stay away. Fire is powerful and hard to control, the sun is the giver of all life and warmth. Red can also be found in clay which can be molded, and there are even stories of creatures and even humans made from clay which gives it another association with life. The strong connotations of life and power make it a natural color for health and strength.


Green is the color of nature. It's seen mostly in plants and while that's life, it's not animal life which makes it not as good of a color for health as red. Plants also have a feeling of swiftness as they move and sway in the wind which is fast. In nature you can't really see the wind outside of how it hits plants so that has a very strong emotional connection to the wind. They also grow quickly which connects to the fast recovery of stamina. Green is typically connected to wind and the wild for these reasons and those are swift things so they make sense for stamina which helps you move faster and recovers quickly. 


Blue is found in the sky and water. Both the sky and the ocean invoke infinity and things beyond us which is connected with spirituality. Water is also a giver of life but it isn't life itself, it provides sustenance for life in the future which gives a connection for wisdom. Blue is also a harder color to make which requires knowledge to produce. For these reasons blue is normally associated with spirituality and wisdom so it's a natural color for mana and magic. ",1

In an article in The New Atlantis, Robert Mariani called the theory a mix between a genuine conspiracy theory and a creepypasta. The dead Internet theory is sometimes used to refer to the observable increase in content generated via large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT appearing in popular Internet spaces without mention of the full theory.

You can split ways of identifying yourself into three categories: something you ""know"" (e.g. a password or pin), something you ""have"" (e.g. a phone or a hardware token), and something you ""are"" (e.g. fingerprint).

 It's more secure because it requires you to verify two things, something you know (Your password) and something you have (Your phone as verified by the code). They can be a lot more sure it's actually you because you you have given them two distinct ways of identifying yourself. 

Think of how your bank card has two factors. You can't just insert the card into a machine and withdraw money, you need to know the PIN for that card. In order to use the card, you need to prove it's you by giving the machine something only you ought to know (your PIN) and by giving it something only you ought to have (Your bank card).

I figured that there were two possibilities: either it would collapse into a morass of flame wars, vandalism, and all the other crap that besets most user-generated sites, or it would get successful and popular and be taken over by corporate interests trying to buy more influence.

Somehow, the people in charge have, so far, managed to navigate around all of those dangers. It's remained a user-edited, user-funded site that's still somehow usable, useful, and valuable.

And being user-funded is critical. Maintaining a website of that size and complexity is expensive, and they very wisely refuse to  monetize the site. That means that the people who use it have to keep donating voluntarily, for as long as we want the site to exist.

Anyway, we are a globally distributed species with a fair degree of genetic isolation owing to that distance, so most examples will be things like that on a regional level.

Evolution is the result.  It is the result of success or failure of procreation and survival.  It is the result of random mutations.  It is the result of illness and intrusion of foreign invaders.  It is random chance of gene mix in offspring.  It is a deficiency in nutrients during embryo development.  It is a randomly cold or warm week during a critical phase of development.

Some just think it's survival of the fittest.  But that's not really accurate.  There's a lot of chance in success.  continuation of the species is all that matters, but each cycle has is own challenges, its own luck, and a better or worse starting point.  In some species even something as simple as the weather and temperate will define the mix of male to female.  That mix could heavily influence which strategies will be competitively advantageous next cycle.  Even for humans, our society changes in leaps and bounds.  What was competitive for our parents might not be competitive for us.  We also do dumb stuff like poison ground water, drink that ground water, and generate health problems or birth defects.  Despite ancestor advantages, something simple like being born in the wrong place can deal you a massive disadvantage towards success.

The successors of each cycle are distinct and different from the prior.  Evolution is that success.  The genetic delta is the evolution difference we recognize and see.",1

1f7q88d,ll9rlzd,catwhowalksbyhimself,"Yes, of course.  While in generally it is a slow process, there are some particular things happening relatively quickly.

One good example is childbirth.  Because of our intelligence, babies are barely able to be born.  This has historically resulted in a lot of them just not fitting through the birth canal, resulting in the deaths of both moth and child.  Only woman with the right hip shape and configuration to give birth to children safely lived.

C-sections have changed all that, and already, more and more women require them as women who normally would have died and been eliminated from the gene pool now live and pass on the inability to give birth without medical intervention to their daughters.  We are evolving to need technology to even give birth.

There's also an extra vein that is in the process of slowly making it's way into the generally population.  Some people have it now, and more do every generation.

Meanwhile, such things as the ability to breathe in high elevations (evolved 3 different ways in 3 different populations) the ability to free dive for extend periods of time, the ability to digest milk as an adult, an additional enzyme in the saliva for digesting things like rice easier, light skin, and malaria resistance are all recent evolutionary adaptations that happened in specific human populations, but not in humanity as a whole.",1

1f7q88d,lla2q5y,theothermeisnothere,"**Are humans still evolving?**

Yes. ALL life forms continue to evolve though not all changes are visible.

Did you know, for example, that the [*palmaris longus*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palmaris_longus_muscle) is a tendon in the wrist area? Well, it exists for about 80-90% of the population. 10-20% of the human population was born without it. In fact, I don't have it. It does help with 'pinch strength' but not grip strength.

The orangutan has it and they can use it. Most gorillas and chimpanzees have it; not all but, more importantly, they don't really use it any more than humans do. That suggests this change began sometime after orangutans split off from the other primates between 13 to 12 million years ago but before gorillas split off about 10 to 8 million  years ago. Potentially 8 to 10 million years to affect 10-20% of the population? Will all humans, gorillas, and chimpanzees lose the palmaris longus? We don't know because no one can predict future evolution.

You don't *see* evolution in larger animals because evolution occurs over *generations*. Many generations. Several genetic mutations that occurred as much as 50,000 years ago combined in a population of *Homo sapiens* (modern humans) in southeastern Europe about 10,000 to 8,000 years ago. Before that time, all humans were some shade of brown. That new combination of mutations led to lower melanin in the skin and gave the world ""white people"" over a period of just 2,000 years. That's maybe 70 to 90 generations. You aren't going to see significant changes in one lifetime if a 'fast' change like that takes 70 to 90 generations.

**If so, what's changing?**

No one can predict what changes are occurring, what is affecting the changes, how tiny changes combine with other changes to eventually produce something you can see, etc. The mutations that occur are random. The survival of the individual or individuals with those mutations is not certain. The spread of those mutations to a regional or the general population takes a VERY long time as mentioned above.",1

1f7q88d,ll9csht,_____michel_____,"There's not likely to be any particular evolution as things stands now. Not unless something happens that would make a particular genetic trait more likely to produce offspring.          

  
It could for example be if a pandemic much worse than covid his us, and we didn't have any vaccines, then whomever had some natural resistance to the disease would be more likely to spread their genes. Stuff like that. 

  
The thing is that thanks to modern medicine, welfare states, and globalism, we're mixing our genes more than ever and also helping ""the weaker"" to stay alive. The survival of the fittest is in the past. 

  
This doesn't mean that evolution has stopped, but that it's likely to have slowed down somewhat for humanity. But it's hard to tell the future. With global warning humanity might face new trials and maybe particular genetic traits will be more likely to spread. 



PS. There might be other less obvious evolution going on that's related to cultural trends, what we eat, etc. Maybe microplastics will factor in. It's hard to tell.

Internet usage through Yahoo/Google/email went rampant towards the end of millennium 2000.

Generally, you can't menstruate twice in a cycle because you only ovulate once. But if you're on the pill, you don't ovulate and can technically make yourself menstruate multiple times in a month by having multiple breaks. But why would anyone do that to themselves?",2
1f7xame,llagfqh,stowRA,"So your body builds up a bunch of cushioning in the uterus to prepare for a baby. You ovulate and eggs are released. About two weeks later, when your body realizes it did not get pregnant, it expels all of that cushioning as menstruation. It’s not just “blood”, but it can have clumps of tissue. Your body will start to rebuild the cushioning in your uterus. Then about two weeks later, you’ll ovulate again. 

The calendar was invented by humans, so no it doesn’t come on the same date every month. It does come like clockwork, though. Typically it’s a 28 day cycle. Meaning the first day of your period is day one. If you are a woman, you will be asked at every doctors appointment when the first day of your last period was. Unrelated but another point to this cycle tracking is because pregnancy gestation is measured at 40 weeks and the cycle starts on the first day of your period, you can technically be 2 weeks pregnant before any implantation occurs. You’re not actually pregnant, but those weeks get counted even if your uterus is empty. 

It is possible to menstruate 2 times a month, but it has to be forced. Taking a Plan B pill will force your body to start menstruation. Periods tend to even out as you get older, so if you’re a preteen-early twenties, you’ll tend to have very irregular periods.

even if all their assets are seized/frozen, they have tons of $$ overseas in a swiss bank, so they can keep financing their drug empire, pay for their legal counsel, generally have access to lots of funding

being lax on it also gets around, and other big money criminals put their $$ into your bank, which is great for your investors and there's no downside, since you will never reveal any names or amounts

&gt; 3/ Re. Your mom; she can feel what she wants, and clearly is not sensitive to others and lashes out with her emotions - that’s not your problem. It sucks for sure, but it doesn’t change anything about you or your life.

Just tell her things like;

- ‘thou shalt not judge mom, leave that to God right? Or it starts to sound blasphemous…’ 

That gets my mom to be quiet / angrier but meh lol…

- ‘say a prayer for me k? I’m sure it will be ok, children are a blessing.’ 

-  ‘do you really believe you raised a sinning Satan worshipper mom?’ + ‘Give yourself a break, God won’t hate me for this and he definitely won’t judge you for loving your child anyway.’

- ‘every saint has a past, and every sinner a future.’ 

Or the real talk:

-  ‘Please, I heard you - here we are - I’m not aborting. So when are you gonna be a mom and grandma? Stop this crusade? Would it help if I go to confession?

- have you been to confession lately? May want to clear the air about all the stones you’re throwing my way when you’re there. 😈

As for your mother, you need to do something I know is almost impossible to do. Maybe dad can help.

You’re definitely gonna be fine. It sounds like you have a fairly stable situation even if it’s gonna be a lot of work. The hardest part is your mom. 

Hopefully she’s just shocked and settles down a little as time goes on. But the last thing you need is unending stress for the baby so I vote that if you really can afford it and stuff, you should absolutely leave if she doesn’t relax and you should tell her that. Hopefully it snaps her out of it. 

God loves all of us, even if we make mistakes. Most saints in the Bible explicitly list their own faults and doesn’t make them out to be perfect people. Paul repeatedly goes on and on about how much he has sinned and how much he’s lucky God still loves him, but he does love him still. And God still loves you. And the Bible says not to judge others and to only focus on yourself. 

“He who is without sin should cast the first stone.” Jesus said that and I have to remind you that *Jesus was without sin!* And instead of stoning the sinner, he showed her love. He embraced her while everyone was belittling her. He still loved her and he still loves you and he loves your baby. Love should always be the first instinct in a Christian’s heart. Lead with love. 

Tell your mom that. 

Maybe you can think of marriage or maybe you can not. That’s up to you. 

But be happy. If you’re keeping it, then a beautiful new chapter of your life is starting. You’re gonna feel love that you never thought you’d be capable of. And you’re gonna be a great mother since you’ll want to be better for your child.

1f7nr87,ll8qq9c,toldyaso,"I'm in my late 40s.

What I would say is that the 2008 recession wasn't much different from the 2001 recession, or the 1994 recession. Lots of people lost their jobs, and when unemployment gets high, companies understand they have more leverage over workers, so they freeze pay and ask for more work, even if the company itself is untouched by the recession.

But.

What I would also say about the 2008 recession is that it's the only recession I've ever lived through that caused **permanent** changes. Like in 94 or 01, things got bad for six months or a year, but then everything went back to normal.

But in 2008, things got really bad for six months or a year, and then one day the TV people told everyone the recession was over... Except no one but the truly rich actually felt it being over. For the rest of us in the middle and lower income classes, the 2008 catastrophe wasn't a recession, it was more of a permanent condition where wages went down and the cost of almost everything went up.

Wages didn't really start to recover until literally 2022, and once they did, inflation immediately eradicated any gains.

Fifteen years later, I am **still** not earning quite as much annually as I did in 2007, and tbh I don't think it's ever going to change.",9
1f7nr87,ll8xw1l,AppropriateRip9996,"Before 2008 the bank was ready to loan me 350k for a house. I said I can't afford that. I just want the 60k please. I had borrowed from two other sources. They said I was being silly because I could buy a bigger house.

I thought banks would give sound advice. But this was weird because I literally couldn't pay back 350k as my household income was less than 50k. $2600 a month just on housing? 

After 2008 I couldn't borrow 30k to improve my house. 

Predatory lending was big back in the day. They get you to borrow too much and then sell your mortgage so it isn't their problem when you fail. This is what caused the crisis.",3

1f7nr87,ll8tgyl,XRay2212xray,"If you lost your job, it sucked. They kept extending unemployment checks so it wasn't as bad as it could have been. If you had a job and kept it, really didn't impact you too much. Depending on where you lived, there were lots of stores and businesses that closed down. The mall near me completely shut down.

A lot of people either couldn't pay their mortgage and lost their house or decided that the value of their house dropped so much that they'd be better off not paying it, losing it, and then buying a new one at a lower price. If you were in the market to buy one at the time, it was good for you as there were piles of choices and in some places the houses were half the price they had been.

Stock market went down. If you were retired and living on that money, it sucked as you had to withdraw at the lower value. If you weren't using the money at the time and didn't pannic and take it out for a loss, the market bounced back and continued to grow for over a decade.

1f7nr87,ll8rbuj,f1guring1t0ut,"It was exceedingly stressful, and we were the lucky ones. 

My wife and I were in our late 20s. My wife worked for a non-profit And I worked in tech. We were just another young couple. We bought a small, run-down condo in 2004 with one of those insane hardly-any-money down mortgages. My wife went to grad school entirely on loans. We had our first baby. 

In 2008, our baby was 2. My wife’s non-profit started losing funding. She was let go. Then, not long after that, I was let go. We were suddenly unemployed with a two year old. I couldn’t sleep for days on end. 

We had our kid in a home day care and the woman who ran it volunteered to watch our kid for free while we looked for new jobs. We refused but she insisted. She said that the priest at her church asked everyone to look out for other people who were going through hard times. She remembered that, years ago, when her husband left her, her neighbors all chipped in and helped her get her kids to soccer, bought her a Christmas tree, lots of small but thoughtful and generous things. She said she wanted to pay it forward for us. 

Because we were unemployed, we had to pay for health insurance through COBRA or go uninsured (this was before Obamacare obv). It was so expensive and I did the math that we would run out of the little savings we had in a few months. But part of the government bailout covered 90% of COBRA and it was the difference between us really losing everything. Our condo lost its value and we owed more on it than it was worth. 

We got an anonymous letter in the mail with a $500 visa gift card in it. We immediately tried to track down who it could be—the return address? My mom’s church? But dead ends. We sent a thank you to the return address, some random house in another town. We never heard back. We used it for groceries for a month. 

It seemed like we were never going to get jobs again. I started quietly planning for what that meant: selling the house at a loss? moving? Moving in with my parents? Bankruptcy? I just wasn’t sure. 

Little by little, I got some freelance work. We stretched it out. My wife landed a new, better job. I kept doing freelance and worked from home. We saved up enough to pay back our day care provider for the time that she watched our kid for free. We started chipping away at the student loans. Things started turning around. I got full time work a couple years later. 

Like I said, we were the lucky ones. You can see how many times in the story above that things could have taken even the slightest turn for the worse and everything would have gone straight to hell—and that’s exactly what happened for lots and lots of people—but somehow we got by.",2

Took 13 months to get a new job at 1/3 my previous pay. During that 13 months, I had one job interview, other than the last one that hired me. We had always lived beneath our means, and I was able to slash our budget so that we could get by on my wife’s salary + my unemployment. I never had to touch my savings or my severance pay. When we bought our house in 2001, we bought a little less than what we could afford, so we had no problems with mortgage or negative equity. 

I did finally get a job in Feb 2010, when unemployment was still really high. Sometimes I had to go to work at 4:30 am, and it was strange how little traffic there was. I had a 35 mile commute, about 20 of it on the highway. When I got off the highway, sometimes during that last 15 miles I wouldn’t see another car (and this was in the Chicago suburbs, not a rural area).

Companies cut out benefits like health insurance, matching 401(k), paid time off, etc. A lot of which never came back. During college I worked in a cafeteria. I had a retirement plan through them as a minimum wage employee. You literally could not find a job. I  ended up working tax prep and there were individuals who came in with active duty military wages and an unemployment statement. Even the military decreased staff. Unemployment was there, but if you lived in a state that didn’t supplement the federal amount by much, you still had it bad. I lived in a rural area that was hit hard.

""Oh, come on. You can't say you tried EVERYTHING.""

That's the level of compassion I got. So I went on welfare. Every go on welfare? You get spoken to like you're brain damaged, lazy, and belligerent. I showed up at the welfare job-search room (part of what you have to do). The guy went through my resume. ""I can't give you a referral. No one will hire you, you have too much education."" So I sat in a chair the whole day, getting no help. The whole reason I went to the welfare office was that I thought they'd find SOME job for me. Something. Anything. Instead, I was lectured about how I needed to be ""respectful"" and ""courteous"" to staff, how I needed to ""shower on the day of the interview"" and other crucial details that even a four-year-old knows. And they wouldn't even send me on a job interview.

Because of the economic hardship, I lost all my friends. I couldn't afford to go out. I sat home and went a little more stir crazy every day. My work history has been irregular ever since 2008.

The schools frequently also don’t cultivate their own competitive athletes - a lot of kids on the “flagship” teams (football, baseball, basketball) arrive at the school with extensive experience from extracurricular activities.

These days, the job market demands people who can perform STEM or use computers, and the government wanted to compete with the world on modernization as computers and science was becoming bigger, so they shifted policies and focus for public schools. 

As a result, P.E. became more of a time for students to get moving, play team sports, maybe some events, and less about their physical health. and instead a health class is a common way to ""teach"" what should be done instead of doing it.",1

Are you athletic at all? I think the one saving grace for me is that my parents put me in Muay Thai classes as a kid and there were kids of all sizes in my gym so once I got the hang of it and started actually sparring. I never really looked at a bigger kid and was fearful because I was usually smaller than the other kids I sparred with and those kids knew how to actually fight so no random kid at school was going to intimidate or bully me unless they wanted a rude awakening haha. 

But anyways it’s really how you carry yourself. For example I’ve been told that I kind of strut when I walk with my head held up. Even at my current job when passing by people I notice most can’t even look you in the eye and say hello or they’re just awkward. I wasn’t always this way. I think naturally as a kid I was an introvert which my parents probably recognized and decided martial arts would be something to boost my confidence. Which is it really did. And it kept me in great shape so really it took care of two aspects of confidence that probably would have been an issue had they just left me to my own devices as a kid.

You gotta find something that you’re good at or have a talent for that will bring that confidence out of you. It doesn’t even have to martial arts it could be something like learning and getting really good at an instrument. Something that shows you can dedicate yourself to it and hone a skill.

1f7vdy9,llaaeni,happyhippohats,"&gt;it feels like technology haven't changed in the last 10 years meaningfully

AI is the big technological advance of the current era, from the launch of Siri/Alexa/Google Assistant to the focus on AI features in the new gen of smartphones (particularly Pixel and Samsung) and it's adoption into the Google search enging, the way we interact with technology has dramatically shifted.

True wireless headphones and noise cancelling headphones have also been huge changes in the last decade. When apple dropped the headphone jack 10 years ago it seemed insane. Foldable screens will provably be seen as a big shift as well, but they haven't been widely adopted yet, and probably won't be until Apple get in on it.

Electric vehicles have only become commercially viable in the last ten years and was a huge disruption to the industry.

The reason technology seems to have stagnated this decade is because of economics - the US dollar and Japanese yen are both in a recession and have significantly lost value in the markets where our tech is manufactured (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Korea, China), so the cost of making hardware has increased instead of decreasing year on year, meaning manufacturers have a choice between raising prices or not doing any meaningful hardware upgrades.

When skin cells are multiplying too much, the body sends them a chemical signal to stop and the result is a mole. Your body contains many mole like structures throughout it where abnormal cells have obeyed the command to stop. Other times, your immune system will detect and destroy abnormal cells, or they will obey a signal to destroy themselves. Cancer is what happens when a cell figures out a way to avoid all these mechanisms.",2
1f7vbm7,lla2cqb,archpawn,"It has mechanisms to deal with it. When cells mutate, they automatically destroy themselves. If they don't destroy themselves, white blood cells will detect them and destroy them. And I'm sure someone who knows more about this can tell you more mechanisms.

The problem is that detecting cancer cells is hard. They're your own cells. And practically every cancer is unique, so you can't just evolve to detect stuff based on what that exact kind of cancer does. And besides that, mutations are incredibly common. So your body does what it can, and on the whole it works really well, but every once in a while it fails.",2

This merely means your ISP can't get more detailed data about your devices, but your traffic still ends up going through their network anyway unless you're using a VPN.

It comes down to how badly someone wants to find you and what resources they can throw at it. Finally it comes down to your OPSEC, just how random can you be? Most people will subconsciously have a pattern. Use a wifi hotspot once too often and they will have you.
